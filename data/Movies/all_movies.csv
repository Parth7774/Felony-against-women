3340,"Django_182_183",4411352580,0,"So, like slavery, it's a flesh for cash business.","Django_Unchained",,
3341,"Django_184",4411352580,0,"What's a bounty?","Django_Unchained",,
3342,"Django_185",4411352580,0,"It's like a reward.","Django_Unchained",,
3343,"Django_186",4411352580,0,"You kill people?","Django_Unchained",,
3344,"Django_187",4411352580,0,"And they give you a reward?","Django_Unchained",,

3353,"Django_197_198",4411352580,0,"So, for the time being, I'm gonna make this slavery malarkey work to my benefit.","Django_Unchained",,
3354,"Django_199_200_201",4411352580,0,"Still, having said that, I feel guilty.","Django_Unchained",,
3355,"Django_202_203",4411352580,0,"So, I would like the two of us to enter into an agreement.","Django_Unchained",,

3359,"Django_209",4411352580,0,"Don't ya?","Django_Unchained",,
3360,"Django_210",4411352580,0,"I know what they look like alright.","Django_Unchained",,
3361,"Django_211_212",4411352580,0,"Good. So here's my agreement.","Django_Unchained",,
3362,"Django_213",4411352580,0,"You travel with me until we find them. Where we going?","Django_Unchained",,
3363,"Django_214_215",4411352580,0,"I hear at least two of them are overseeing up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where.","Django_Unchained",,
3364,"Django_216_217",4411352580,0,"That means we visit every plantation in Gatlinburg till we find them.","Django_Unchained",,
3365,"Django_218_219_220",4411352580,0,"And when we find them, you point them out, and I kill them.","Django_Unchained",,
3366,"Django_221_222_223",4411352580,0,"You do that, I agree to give you your freedom, $25 per Brittle Brother.","Django_Unchained",,
3367,"Django_224",4411352580,0,"That's $75.","Django_Unchained",,
3368,"Django_225_226",4411352580,0,"And as if on cue, here comes the sheriff.","Django_Unchained",,
3369,"Django_227",4411352580,0,"Ok, boys.","Django_Unchained",,
3370,"Django_228",4411352581,0,"Fun's over.","Django_Unchained",,
3371,"Django_229",4411352581,0,"Come on out.","Django_Unchained",,

3375,"Django_234_235",4411352581,0,"Now, why you all wanna come into my town and start trouble?","Django_Unchained",,
3376,"Django_236",4411352581,0,"Scare all these nice people.","Django_Unchained",,
