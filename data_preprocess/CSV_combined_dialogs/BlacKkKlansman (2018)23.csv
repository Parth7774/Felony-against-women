300,429,"00:27:23,854","00:27:28,341","Patrice... she's the one from the Black Student Union, the group that brought in Ture?"
301,430,"00:27:28,342","00:27:31,377","- Kwame Ture. Correct, sir. - Getting pretty chummy with her, huh?"
302,431,"00:27:31,378","00:27:33,913","No, just doing my job, Chief. Undercover."
303,432,"00:27:33,914","00:27:36,149",Let's just make sure it ain't under the cover of the sheets.
304,433,"00:27:36,150","00:27:41,854","- I would never jeopardize a case, sir. - He doesn't know what he'd do. You're new."
305,434,"00:27:41,855","00:27:45,413","You guys sit tight. Ron, come with me."
306,435,"00:27:46,327","00:27:51,598","- Ron, I'm transferring you to Intelligence. - What will I be doing there?"
307,436_437,"00:27:51,599","00:27:56,769",Intelligence. Against my better judgment.

315,450,"00:28:45,786","00:28:49,889","I saw your advertisement in the ""Colorado Springs Gazette""."
316,451,"00:28:49,890","00:28:53,726",I'm interested in receiving some reading materials from you.

324,460,"00:29:35,335","00:29:37,225",What's your story?
325,461,"00:29:40,374","00:29:43,898","Well, since you asked..."
326,462,"00:29:44,411","00:29:47,312","Since you asked, I hate niggers."
327,463,"00:29:47,313","00:29:49,282",- I hate Jews. - Huh?
328,464,"00:29:49,283","00:29:53,453",Spics and Micks. Dagos and Chinks.
329,465,"00:29:53,454","00:29:56,990","But my mouth to God's ears, I really hate those nigger rats."
330,466_467,"00:29:56,991","00:30:01,128","And anyone else, really, that doesn't have pure white Aryan blood running through their veins."
331,468_469,"00:30:01,129","00:30:07,234","My sister, Pamela, she was just recently accosted by one of those black coons."
332,470,"00:30:07,235","00:30:09,702",- Is that so? - Yeah.
333,471_472,"00:30:09,703","00:30:15,708",Every time I think about that black baboon putting his filthy black hands on her pure-as-white-driven-snow body...
334,473,"00:30:15,709","00:30:20,313","I mean pure, Walter. She's a saint. She's an angel. It makes me want to puke."
335,474,"00:30:20,314","00:30:24,117",You are just the kind of guy that we are looking for.
336,475,"00:30:24,118","00:30:28,514","- Listen, uh, when can you meet? - How about Friday night after I get off work?"
337,476,"00:30:28,515","00:30:31,324","That's a deal, buddy boy. We'll get right back to you with the details."

339,478,"00:30:36,830","00:30:39,421",Did I just hear you use your real name?
340,479,"00:30:40,301","00:30:41,701","Oh, motherfucker."
341,480,"00:30:41,702","00:30:43,903"," Yeah, motherfucker amateur hour."
342,481,"00:30:43,904","00:30:46,005","FLIP: That's your real name, right? Isn't..."
343,482_483,"00:30:46,006","00:30:48,809","Isn't it Ron Stallworth? Right, isn't that - his real name? - Can't believe he just said that."
344,484,"00:30:48,810","00:30:51,410","Well, good luck, Ron, with your new redneck friends."
345,486,"00:30:52,446","00:30:56,816",- They want you to join the Klan? - They want to meet me first.
346,487,"00:30:56,817","00:30:58,518",- They want to meet you? - Mm-hmm.
347,488,"00:30:58,519","00:31:01,587","Yeah, well, you probably shouldn't go to that meeting."
348,489,"00:31:01,588","00:31:05,180","- Good call, Sarge. - So you're a crazy son of a bitch, huh?"
349,490,"00:31:05,626","00:31:09,729","We'd have to go to Narcotics, meaning we'd have to deal with Chief Bridges."
350,491,"00:31:09,730","00:31:11,731","Yeah, I can't spare the men."
351,492_493,"00:31:11,732","00:31:15,005","TRAPP: Well, I've looked over the logs, Chief, and it seems you can spare them."
352,494,"00:31:15,006","00:31:18,471","Sergeant Trapp, Ron spoke to the man on the phone."
353,495,"00:31:18,472","00:31:22,375","All right, when they hear the voice of one of my guys, they're gonna know the difference."
354,496,"00:31:22,376","00:31:26,511","- How so, Chief? - You want me to spell it out for you?"
355,497,"00:31:26,512","00:31:31,852",They're going to know the difference between how a white man talks and a Negro.
356,498,"00:31:31,853","00:31:34,386",How exactly does a black man talk?
357,499,"00:31:34,387","00:31:37,090","Okay, Ron, what I think the chief is trying to say..."
358,500,"00:31:37,091","00:31:38,825","If you don't mind, I'd like to speak for myself."
359,501,"00:31:38,826","00:31:39,892","- Thank you, Sarge. - Sure."
360,502,"00:31:39,893","00:31:42,963","- You know what I'm trying to say. - Chief, some of us can speak King's English."
361,503,"00:31:42,964","00:31:44,865",Others speak jive.
362,504,"00:31:44,866","00:31:48,301",Ron Stallworth here happens to be fluent in both.
363,506,"00:31:49,903","00:31:53,906","Okay, Ron, how do you propose to make this investigation?"
364,507,"00:31:53,907","00:31:59,012","Well, I've established contact and created some familiarity with the Klansman over the phone."
365,508,"00:31:59,013","00:32:01,414","I'll continue in that role, but I'll need another officer..."
366,509,"00:32:01,415","00:32:05,685","surprise, surprise, a white officer to play me when they meet face-to-face."
367,510_511,"00:32:05,686","00:32:14,333","- See, that's my point exactly. - Chief, black Ron Stallworth over the phone, white Ron Stallworth face-to-face, so there becomes a combined Ron Stallworth."
368,512,"00:32:14,334","00:32:16,396",- Can you do that? - I believe we can.
369,513,"00:32:16,397","00:32:19,154","With the right white man, we can do anything."
370,514_515,"00:32:19,900","00:32:24,994","Anything happens to one of my men, there won't be two Ron Stallworths."
371,516,"00:32:24,995","00:32:26,439",There'll be none.
372,519,"00:32:31,745","00:32:33,512",FLIP: You're late.
373,520,"00:32:33,513","00:32:37,350",- Sorry. It'll never happen again. - Seems like I heard that one before.
374,521,"00:32:37,351","00:32:40,153","FLIP: Jimmy, when's the last time they let a rookie lead an investigation?"
375,522,"00:32:40,154","00:32:43,256","- Oh, that's right... never. -  Okay, all right, let's move on."
376,523,"00:32:43,257","00:32:45,591","Let's, uh... let's go to our bio."
377,524,"00:32:45,592","00:32:48,594",Okay. Ron Stallworth. I do wholesale manufacturing.
378,525,"00:32:48,595","00:32:50,363",- Whereabout? - Pueblo.
379,526,"00:32:50,364","00:32:52,782","- What's that commute like? - Jimmy, I'm glad you asked."
380,527,"00:32:52,783","00:32:54,334",It's a straight shot down I-25.
381,528,"00:32:54,335","00:32:56,168","- Hour, tops. - It's a long ride."
382,529_530,"00:32:56,169","00:33:02,242","- What do we listen to? - KWYD, Christian talk in the morning, although the signal starts to cut out near Pueblo."
383,531,"00:33:02,243","00:33:07,047","On the way back, I like to turn it to 102.7 to get my Allman Brothers fix."
384,532_533,"00:33:07,048","00:33:11,384","Only I have to change it every time that British fag, - David Bowie, pipes on. - JIMMY: Whoa!"
385,534,"00:33:11,385","00:33:13,819","- I love Bowie. - I mean, who doesn't, right?"
386,535_536,"00:33:13,820","00:33:21,368","Remember, you have to retain all the information you share with these guys - so I can be white Ron Stallworth. - Jimmy, I always wanted to be black."
387,537,"00:33:21,369","00:33:23,663",All my heroes were black guys.

396,546,"00:33:40,781","00:33:44,884","We as a Negro people appreciate your love, but don't share that love with these guys."
397,547,"00:33:44,885","00:33:48,754","- For you, it's the fucking Osmonds, right? - Hey, I love Marie Osmond."
398,548,"00:33:48,755","00:33:51,258","I get to play you, but you don't get to play me?"
399,549,"00:33:51,259","00:33:52,633","Jimmy, does that sound fair?"
400,550,"00:33:52,634","00:33:54,026","- Fair? - Not to me. Now, what else?"
401,551,"00:33:54,027","00:33:58,165",- Wh...who are you meeting with? - Walter... Breachway.
402,552,"00:33:58,166","00:34:04,271","- Become his friend. Let's get invited back. - Well, look at you. Okay. Anything else, sir?"
403,553,"00:34:04,272","00:34:06,306",I'm on the phone with the Klan.
404,554,"00:34:06,307","00:34:09,109",- You meet with them in person. - And?
405,556,"00:34:11,611","00:34:15,881","- And you need to try and sound like my voice. -  Oh, boy."

452,617,"00:37:36,883","00:37:41,227","- You for the white race, Ron? - Oh, hell yeah."
453,618,"00:37:41,228","00:37:43,556",Been having trouble lately with these local niggers.
454,619,"00:37:43,557","00:37:46,492","Ah, since the Civil War, it's always trouble with niggers."
455,621,"00:37:48,328","00:37:51,198",- Walter said something about your sister. - Makes me sick.
456,622,"00:37:51,199","00:37:51,899",What are they saying?
457,623_624_625,"00:37:51,900","00:38:02,275","- They saying where they're going? -  But it's also, you know, camaraderie - I'm looking for with the Klan. - What the fuck did you say?"
458,626,"00:38:02,276","00:38:05,568","- Camaraderie? - No, the other word."
459,627,"00:38:06,047","00:38:09,082","- The Klan? - Not ""the Klan""."
460,628,"00:38:09,083","00:38:11,284","It's ""the Organization""."
461,629,"00:38:11,285","00:38:15,888",The Invisible Empire has managed to stay invisible for a reason.
462,630,"00:38:15,889","00:38:19,159",Do not ever use that word.
463,631,"00:38:19,160","00:38:23,463","- You understand? - Hey, I over-stand. Right. You got it."
464,632,"00:38:23,464","00:38:25,520",The Organization.
465,633,"00:38:32,139","00:38:34,907",Check this shit out. You're never gonna believe this.
466,634_635,"00:38:34,908","00:38:38,634",What? A fucking jig on our bumper.
467,636,"00:38:40,581","00:38:42,838","- Ron, he sees us. Back off. - Damn!"
468,637,"00:38:46,787","00:38:49,489",Let's get ready. Look under your seat.
469,638,"00:38:49,490","00:38:51,024",- Yeah. - What?
470,639_641,"00:38:51,025","00:39:01,991",- Pull it out. -  Load 'er up. Put two in the chamber.
471,642,"00:39:02,570","00:39:04,894","Come on, load it up."
472,643,"00:39:06,373","00:39:08,430","Come on, load it."
473,644,"00:39:09,343","00:39:11,111",Don't be messing with us.
474,645,"00:39:11,112","00:39:16,182","-  The Organization. - Not so fast, buddy boy."
475,646,"00:39:16,183","00:39:20,508",Hold your horses.
476,647_648,"00:39:28,495","00:39:30,896","Mmm. Ron, glad you could make it."
477,649,"00:39:30,897","00:39:32,365","Walter Breachway, chapter president."
478,650,"00:39:32,366","00:39:34,267",Ron Stallworth. I appreciate you inviting me out.
479,651,"00:39:34,268","00:39:37,570",Absolutely. I've been impressed with our conversations over the phone.
480,652,"00:39:37,571","00:39:40,107",I think you have a lot of fine ideas that could really help the cause.
481,653,"00:39:40,108","00:39:41,271","Well, I meant every word I said."
482,654,"00:39:41,272","00:39:44,010","You know, I've had my own share of run-ins with niggers."
483,655,"00:39:44,011","00:39:47,247","Matter of fact, it's what led me to the Organization."
484,656,"00:39:47,248","00:39:49,516","- Is that right? - Oh, it's become my salvation."
485,657,"00:39:49,517","00:39:51,284","See, I was, uh..."
486,658,"00:39:51,285","00:39:53,986",shot and wounded by a couple niggers.
487,659,"00:39:53,987","00:39:56,722",Then my wife was savagely raped by a whole pack of 'em.
488,660,"00:39:56,723","00:39:59,024","- God. - That's right, and not a one of them went to jail."
489,661,"00:39:59,025","00:40:02,095",- Huh. - Tell you what.
490,662,"00:40:02,096","00:40:03,963",They're taking over.
491,663,"00:40:03,964","00:40:06,366","Hell, it's all you see on TV anymore."
492,664,"00:40:06,367","00:40:08,368",Niggers selling soap. Niggers selling toothpaste.
493,665,"00:40:08,369","00:40:09,769",Niggers selling automobiles.
494,666,"00:40:09,770","00:40:12,439"," Everywhere you look, it's niggers, niggers, niggers."
495,667,"00:40:12,440","00:40:15,942","Yeah, wasn't long ago them sumbitches wasn't on no TV."
496,668,"00:40:15,943","00:40:18,478",You're forgetting about Uncle Ben and Aunt Jemima.
497,669,"00:40:18,479","00:40:19,979","Oh, dang."
498,670_671,"00:40:19,980","00:40:25,285",- I kind of like them niggers. -  Rice and pancakes.
499,672,"00:40:25,286","00:40:28,555","- Hey, uh, my name's Ivanhoe, by the way. - Hey. Ron."
500,673,"00:40:28,556","00:40:33,426","Hey, all you get now is how we gotta cater to them. Now, watch your mouth. Yeah."
501,674,"00:40:33,427","00:40:36,897",Don't say this. Don't say that. Be nice.
502,675,"00:40:36,898","00:40:40,233","- Hell, they ain't even colored no more. - Negroes. Blacks."
503,676,"00:40:40,234","00:40:42,435","- Afro-Americans now. - Yeah, fuck it."
504,677,"00:40:42,436","00:40:45,205",Just call them fucking niggers. Make it fucking simple.
505,678,"00:40:45,206","00:40:47,173",-  Niggers. - OTHERS: Niggers.
506,679,"00:40:47,174","00:40:49,576",- That's the right idea. - I've been saying this stuff for years.
507,680,"00:40:49,577","00:40:52,779","- Well, you ain't the only one. - It's good to know someone else gets it."
508,681,"00:40:52,780","00:40:55,481","So, what kind of stuff you guys do?"
509,682_683,"00:40:55,982","00:41:04,123","What kind of stuff we do? We, uh... uh, cross burnings and marches and stuff so people don't fuck with us."
510,684,"00:41:04,124","00:41:07,761","- I'm tired of niggers fucking with me. - Well, then you come to the right place."
511,685,"00:41:07,762","00:41:09,562",Nobody fucks with us.
512,686,"00:41:09,563","00:41:12,855","Now, how much you know about the history?"
513,687,"00:41:13,434","00:41:16,403",- Some. I could know more. - We will teach you.
514,688,"00:41:16,404","00:41:21,663","- Yeah, this is fixing to be a big year for us. - How so?"
515,689,"00:41:26,347","00:41:27,814",- Boom! -  All right.
516,690_691,"00:41:27,815","00:41:33,019","- We're gonna make fireworks, aren't we? - All right, all right, Ivanhoe, shut your dumb mouth. Ivan, shut the fuck up."
517,692,"00:41:33,020","00:41:34,721","- Burnt ends. - All right, all right."
518,693,"00:41:34,722","00:41:38,191",That's enough. Shut your dumb mouth. Sorry about him. He drinks too much.
519,694_695,"00:41:38,192","00:41:41,955","Doesn't know what he's saying.  Just to be clear, the, uh..."
520,696_697,"00:41:41,954","00:41:48,801","- the Organization is strictly nonviolent. - Oh, nonviolent like that nigger, that dead nigger, Martin Luther Coon."
521,698,"00:41:48,802","00:41:52,405","- Yeah, gotcha. - Ron? You mind coming with me?"
522,699,"00:41:52,406","00:41:55,998","- Yeah, where to? - You undercover or something?"
523,700,"00:41:56,911","00:42:01,548","- You ask too many questions. - WALTER: All right. Be friendly, now."
524,701,"00:42:01,549","00:42:04,384",This is family. All right?
525,702,"00:42:04,385","00:42:06,152",Let's go.
526,703,"00:42:06,153","00:42:09,222",Congrats. You passed the mustard.
527,704,"00:42:09,223","00:42:12,125",How about we go and get that membership process started?
528,705,"00:42:12,126","00:42:13,927",- That's it? - That's it.
529,706,"00:42:13,928","00:42:15,528","Uh, have a seat."
530,707,"00:42:15,529","00:42:19,962","Go ahead and, uh, fill these out. Send them to the national headquarters."
531,708_709,"00:42:19,963","00:42:25,505","Now, once they send you your membership card, you'll be able to participate in all our programs."
532,710,"00:42:25,506","00:42:29,175",- Alcoa can't wait. -  I love those commercials.
533,711,"00:42:29,176","00:42:33,413","Imperial tax to become a member: ten dollars for the year, $15 chapter fee."
534,712,"00:42:33,414","00:42:36,115",Robes and hoods are not included. That's extra.
535,713,"00:42:36,116","00:42:38,998",- Fucking inflation. - I can't thank you brothers enough.
536,714,"00:42:38,999","00:42:40,487",This means a lot to me.
537,715,"00:42:40,488","00:42:44,457","- Pleasure's all ours. - You're not a Jew, right? Jews killed Christ."
538,716,"00:42:44,458","00:42:48,350",- Are you trying to offend me? - Protocol.
539,717,"00:42:52,433","00:42:57,136","- Course I'm no stinkin' kike. - All right, look, we gotta ask it, is all, but..."
540,718,"00:42:57,137","00:43:01,508","- he's not a Jew, all right? Satisfied? - Sm... smells kosher to me."
541,719,"00:43:01,509","00:43:03,810",- Stop fucking around. - I fuck straight.
542,720,"00:43:03,811","00:43:05,378",- Who you fucking? - Double D!
543,721,"00:43:05,379","00:43:08,808","All right, both of you, give the man some space. Jesus Christ. Let him breathe a little."
544,722,"00:43:08,809","00:43:10,216","Ron, let me buy you a beer."
545,723,"00:43:10,217","00:43:11,217",- Okay. - Come on.
546,724,"00:43:11,218","00:43:15,288","Sorry about these guys. They're a little, uh, too friendly sometimes."
547,725,"00:43:15,289","00:43:16,723",They just get excited.
548,727,"00:43:18,325","00:43:19,325",IVANHOE:  Yeah.
549,728,"00:43:19,326","00:43:22,161","- WALTER: What kind of beer you like? - FLIP: Coors, if you got it."
550,729,"00:43:22,802","00:43:25,131",That was interesting.
551,730,"00:43:25,532","00:43:28,635",Not exactly the Beverly Hillbillies.
552,731,"00:43:28,636","00:43:33,072",- They liked you. - Except for that Felix guy.
553,732,"00:43:33,073","00:43:35,909",- Do not ride his bumper like that. - Two car lengths.
554,733,"00:43:35,910","00:43:39,479",- You think he got a good look at my face? - Probably.
555,734,"00:43:39,480","00:43:42,171",You get the papers?
556,735,"00:43:43,150","00:43:46,819","-  They want you to join. - Uh, technically, they want you to join."
557,736_737,"00:43:46,820","00:43:51,858","Yeah. Yeah, they want a black man to join the Ku Klux Klan. I'd say that's mission impossible."
558,738_739,"00:43:51,859","00:43:57,130","- Double success. -  - We're in! - Slow down, brother. Slow down."
559,740,"00:43:57,131","00:44:00,700",And exactly how much should we be worried about them?
560,741,"00:44:00,701","00:44:02,767",Enough that we'd like to dig deeper.
561,742,"00:44:02,768","00:44:05,305","One of the men discussed plans for a possible attack, so..."
562,743,"00:44:05,306","00:44:07,574",I wouldn't give him that much credit.
563,744,"00:44:07,575","00:44:10,343",- These guys like to boast. - What kind of attack?
564,745,"00:44:10,344","00:44:12,145","Uh, Ivan..."
565,746,"00:44:12,146","00:44:15,214","Ivanhoe said ""boom,"" mentioned something about fireworks."
566,747,"00:44:15,215","00:44:17,750","But personally, I didn't buy it. I... I doubt they're even capable."
567,748,"00:44:17,751","00:44:21,854","Either way, at this point, we're looking for full support from the department on this, Sarge."
568,749,"00:44:21,855","00:44:26,292",Let's move on with the investigation. Let's try to find out if they are capable of anything.
569,750_751,"00:44:26,293","00:44:29,463","Okay. - RON: Thank you, Sarge. - You got it."
570,752_753_754_755_756,"00:44:29,464","00:44:45,211","[""BRANDY (YOU'RE A FINE GIRL)"" by Looking Glass plays] When we dropped Brother Kwame off at the airport, he told me that the Black Power movement needed strong sisters like me to lead the fight against capitalist oppression and the politicians and pigs who perpetuate it."
571,757,"00:44:45,212","00:44:48,447",His words almost made that whole pig nightmare worthwhile.
572,758,"00:44:55,722","00:44:59,891",- What's wrong? - What do you mean?
573,759,"00:44:59,892","00:45:01,783",What's wrong?
574,760,"00:45:03,497","00:45:07,700",- I don't really use that word. - What word?
575,761,"00:45:07,701","00:45:10,536","- ""Pigs."" - Well, what else would you call them?"
576,762_763_764,"00:45:10,537","00:45:17,277",Cops. Police. - Officers. - A bunch of racist cops on a power trip.
577,765,"00:45:17,278","00:45:19,179","So, you think all cops are racist?"
578,766,"00:45:19,180","00:45:23,115",It only takes one to pull a trigger on an innocent sister or brother.
579,767_768,"00:45:23,116","00:45:31,258",Hmm. - Why were you at Brother Kwame's speech? - He's got some good ideas.
580,769,"00:45:31,259","00:45:36,062","I don't agree with all of them, but he's a smart brother, definitely worth hearing."
581,770,"00:45:36,063","00:45:38,398",Are you down for the liberation of black people?
582,771,"00:45:38,399","00:45:42,652",- Do we always have to talk politics? - What's more important?
583,772,"00:45:42,653","00:45:44,337",Do you ever take time off?
584,773_774,"00:45:44,338","00:45:52,979","- No. It's a lifetime job. -  Sister Angela Davis, most righteous sister, can we please spend some quality time together?"
585,775,"00:45:52,980","00:45:57,017","- And what did you say your J-O-B is? - Sister Kathleen Cleaver, I didn't."
586,776,"00:45:57,018","00:45:58,574",Are you a pig?
587,777,"00:45:59,253","00:46:00,520",Excuse me?
588,778,"00:46:00,521","00:46:02,621",Are you a pig?
589,779,"00:46:02,622","00:46:04,924",- You mean a cop? - Are you a cop?
590,780_781_782,"00:46:04,925","00:46:17,136","No. I'm in construction. But more importantly, I'm a black man who wants to get to know a strong, intelligent, beautiful sister."
591,783,"00:46:17,137","00:46:20,073",The very one I'm looking at right now.
592,784,"00:46:26,981","00:46:28,648",You dig?
593,785,"00:46:28,649","00:46:30,483",Sure enough.
594,786,"00:46:30,484","00:46:32,251",That's what I'm talking about. Power to the people.
595,787,"00:46:32,252","00:46:33,754",All power to all the people.
596,788,"00:46:33,755","00:46:36,322","- That's right, sister. - Right on, right on."
597,790,"00:46:38,692","00:46:41,861",- This is Walter. - Ron here.
598,791,"00:46:41,862","00:46:43,763",This is Ron?
599,792,"00:46:43,764","00:46:46,967","Sorry, your voice sounds different over the phone."
600,793_794,"00:46:46,968","00:46:52,739",Uh...  - My allergies... allergies acting up again. - I get those all the time.
601,795,"00:46:52,740","00:46:56,175","Listen, wanted to tell you that it was a real pleasure to have you swing by."
602,796,"00:46:56,176","00:46:59,111",I think the brothers really took a liking to you.
603,797,"00:46:59,112","00:47:00,146",I'm honored.
604,798,"00:47:00,147","00:47:02,281","If you're free Saturday, why don't you swing by Felix's."
605,799,"00:47:02,282","00:47:04,450","You can meet the rest of the brotherhood, hmm?"

914,1192,"01:09:31,299","01:09:36,255","Plastered all over my windshield, but they're all over the neighborhood, too. Is this real?"
915,1193,"01:09:36,877","01:09:38,538",Real as can be.

1002,1314,"01:16:40,394","01:16:43,296",- Yeah? - New ideas.
1003,1315,"01:16:43,297","01:16:48,301","For that reason, I'm planning to step down as your president."
1004,1316,"01:16:48,302","01:16:51,471",But I would like to make a nomination.
1005,1317,"01:16:51,472","01:16:56,226",- Mr. Ron Stallworth for chapter president. - We just met this guy.
1006,1318,"01:16:56,227","01:16:59,600",He just walked in off the street.
1007,1319,"01:17:00,441","01:17:02,675",Let me ask a question.
1008,1320,"01:17:02,776","01:17:06,152",Is there anybody here who's willing to put their neck on the line for Ron?
1009,1321,"01:17:06,153","01:17:07,820",I'll vouch for Ron.
1010,1322,"01:17:07,821","01:17:09,822",You know who else vouches for Ron?
1011,1323,"01:17:09,823","01:17:13,960","- Mr. Duke. - Look, it's a big honor, but I... I can't accept."
1012,1324,"01:17:13,961","01:17:18,264","The trouble is, what you good men need is a president who will be constant."
1013,1325,"01:17:18,265","01:17:21,828","On call day in, day out. My old man is sick. I just found out."
1014,1326,"01:17:21,829","01:17:24,270",So I'm going to be back and forth between here and Dallas.

1018,1330,"01:17:31,545","01:17:33,546",Make up your mind.
1019,1331,"01:17:33,547","01:17:36,716",Dallas is where the layover is. El Paso is where my father is.

1027,1344_1345_1346,"01:18:10,351","01:18:19,559","Me? Yeah. I mean, I can tell that you're a..."
1028,1347,"01:18:19,560","01:18:24,230",pure Aryan white man from the way you pronounce certain words.
1029,1349,"01:18:28,869","01:18:32,739","- Can you give me any examples? - Yeah, take the word..."
1030,1350,"01:18:32,740","01:18:38,244","uh, ""are"". Pure Aryan like you or I would pronounce it correctly. ""Are""."
1031,1351,"01:18:38,245","01:18:45,318","Negro pronounces it ""are-uh."" Did you ever notice that? It's like, ""Are-uh..."

1035,1358,"01:19:08,475","01:19:10,643",-  - Yeah.
1036,1359,"01:19:10,644","01:19:14,780",I'd love to continue this conversation in Colorado Springs.

1092,1434,"01:23:57,664","01:24:00,522",thought it might be of interest to you.
1093,1435,"01:24:02,303","01:24:05,405","If you know about a possible attack, I need to know when."
1094,1436,"01:24:05,406","01:24:08,041",You're the one with the impressive investigation.

1118,1464,"01:25:25,619","01:25:28,095","Well, at least I would be doing something, unlike you."
1119,1465,"01:25:28,096","01:25:30,157",- Unlike me? - Yeah.
1120,1466_1467_1468_1469,"01:25:30,158","01:25:43,102","Don't think, just because I don't wear a black beret or a black leather jacket, black Ray-Bans, screaming, ""Kill Whitey,"" - that I don't care about my people. - The night we saw Brother Kwame speak, were you undercover then, too?"
1121,1470,"01:25:43,103","01:25:44,137",That's not fair.
1122,1471,"01:25:44,138","01:25:45,604",- You have to understand... - Answer the question.
1123,1472,"01:25:45,605","01:25:49,142",Were you undercover the night we met? Yes or no?

1141,1493,"01:27:00,081","01:27:02,982",And there's been nothing more about the explosives?
1142,1494_1495,"01:27:02,983","01:27:05,252",No. Fuck it.
1143,1496,"01:27:05,253","01:27:07,821",We get 'em on weapons charges and stop them from doing anything that way.

1145,1498,"01:27:09,723","01:27:11,757",- Then they walk. - I have a special assignment for Ron.

1148,1504,"01:27:22,869","01:27:26,940","With all due respect, sir, I don't think this is a wise decision, given the situation."
1149,1505,"01:27:26,941","01:27:31,244",Who cares what you think? Duke needs protection. There's no one else available.
1150,1506,"01:27:31,245","01:27:32,878",Nut-cracking time.
1151,1507,"01:27:32,879","01:27:36,849","- Put aside your personal politics. - Chief, it's not about that, and you know it."
1152,1508,"01:27:36,850","01:27:39,953",David Duke and Ron have been talking on the phone several times.
1153,1509,"01:27:39,954","01:27:41,421",If he recognizes his voice...
1154,1510,"01:27:41,422","01:27:45,726","If... if... if... if any of the Klansmen do, it'll compromise our entire investigation."

1156,1513,"01:27:54,335","01:27:56,702",- Do you remember that? - Answer the chief.
1157,1514,"01:27:56,703","01:27:58,108","Oh, shut the fuck up, Landers."
1158,1515,"01:27:58,109","01:28:00,373","You know, you've been trying to sabotage me since day one."
1159,1516,"01:28:00,374","01:28:02,275","Why are you getting so worked up, boy?"
1160,1517,"01:28:02,276","01:28:03,876","- Hey, Ron! - Hey, Ron, come on."

1165,1522,"01:28:09,550","01:28:11,384","Gotta bring something to get something, Landers."
1166,1523,"01:28:11,385","01:28:14,520",LANDERS: Eat a white dick!
1167,1524,"01:28:14,521","01:28:17,890",You let him get to you that easy?
1168,1525,"01:28:17,891","01:28:21,316",You don't have a shot with David Duke.
1169,1526,"01:28:24,919","01:28:26,632","First, the primary target."
1170,1527,"01:28:26,633","01:28:28,508",Felix says you're doing it.
1171,1528,"01:28:28,509","01:28:34,040","So all you have to do is set the pocketbook on the front porch, the back porch, a sidewalk."
1172,1529,"01:28:34,041","01:28:38,511","Doesn't matter. As long as it's against the building, you can plant it anywhere."
1173,1530,"01:28:38,512","01:28:42,349",I got enough C-4 here to take out the whole thing.
1174,1531,"01:28:42,350","01:28:45,083",Be careful.
1175,1532,"01:28:45,084","01:28:47,387",- You understand? - I understand.
1176,1533,"01:28:47,388","01:28:49,822","All you have to do when you placed it... hey, sweetie."
1177,1534,"01:28:49,823","01:28:54,494",You listening? All you have to do when you placed it is flip the switch.
1178,1535,"01:28:54,495","01:28:58,587",Flip the switch. That's it. You got it?
1179,1536,"01:29:00,968","01:29:05,305",Miss Black Student Union Bitch is bringing in some old coon to speak.
