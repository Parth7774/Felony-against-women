583,886,"00:41:22,683","00:41:24,600","Sure, hon. Good night."
584,887,"00:41:34,653","00:41:35,653",There's a ghost!

586,889,"00:41:41,160","00:41:42,660",Satan! Satan is coming here?
587,890,"00:41:44,079","00:41:46,539","Saddam Hussein? That doesn't make sense, Kenny!"
588,891,"00:41:49,793","00:41:52,503","- Eric, what is it? - I saw him! I saw Kenny!"
589,892,"00:41:52,588","00:41:55,840",Oh! You poor dear. You've been through so much.
590,893,"00:41:55,924","00:41:58,134",I bet him he couldn't light a fart on fire and now he's all pissed off!
591,894,"00:41:59,303","00:42:00,845","I can't say ""pissed off""?"
592,895,"00:42:02,931","00:42:05,391",The execution of Terrance and Phillip is imminent.
593,896,"00:42:05,476","00:42:08,019","Soon, Saddam and I will rule the world."
594,897,"00:42:10,272","00:42:13,274","Hi, Satan. I got some new luggage for our trip up to Earth."
595,898,"00:42:13,359","00:42:14,442",Let's fuck to celebrate.
596,899,"00:42:14,526","00:42:17,695","What's it like up on Earth, Saddam? Tell me about it again."
597,900,"00:42:17,780","00:42:19,822",Let's not talk. Let's get busy.
598,901,"00:42:19,907","00:42:21,699",Do you remember when you first got here?
599,902,"00:42:21,784","00:42:24,869",We used to talk all night long until the sun came up.
600,903,"00:42:24,953","00:42:27,622",We would just lie in bed and talk.
601,904,"00:42:27,706","00:42:30,333","Well, yeah, 'cause I was still waiting to get you in bed, dummy!"
602,905,"00:42:30,417","00:42:32,877",How come you always wanna make love to me from behind?
603,906,"00:42:32,961","00:42:35,671",Is it because you want to pretend I'm somebody else?
604,907,"00:42:35,756","00:42:38,299","Satan, your ass is gigantic and red."
605,908,"00:42:38,384","00:42:41,427","Who am I gonna pretend you are, Liza Minnelli?"
606,909,"00:42:42,805","00:42:45,139",Ah! Don't get all pissy!

611,941,"00:44:58,524","00:45:00,608","I have to say ""behind"" 'cause I get shocked if I say ""ass""..."
612,942,"00:45:01,777","00:45:05,363","- Did you bring the punch and pie? - No, you guys, something happened."
613,943,"00:45:05,447","00:45:07,698",- I don't think Kenny's dead. - What?
614,944,"00:45:07,783","00:45:08,824",I saw him in my room.
615,945,"00:45:08,909","00:45:11,202","I know, Cartman, I know. I see Kenny every day."
616,946,"00:45:11,286","00:45:13,871","- You do? - Sure, dude, on the face of every child."
617,947,"00:45:13,956","00:45:14,914",On the smile of every baby.

621,952,"00:45:29,805","00:45:30,846",Who is it?
622,953,"00:45:30,931","00:45:32,390",I'm here for la R sistance.
623,954,"00:45:32,474","00:45:35,017",- What's the password? - I don't know.
624,955,"00:45:35,102","00:45:37,645",- Guess. - Bacon.
625,956_957,"00:45:38,480","00:45:44,860","Okay. Oh, no, it's that kid!"
626,958,"00:45:44,945","00:45:47,238",- This is the place. - Wendy?
627,959,"00:45:47,322","00:45:49,323",Stan? You started la R sistance?
628,960,"00:45:50,492","00:45:52,618","Well, apparently you're more political than we thought."
629,961,"00:45:52,703","00:45:54,704",Let us get this meeting underway. There are others coming.
630,962,"00:45:58,250","00:46:00,585","Wow, a lot of people showed up."
631,963_964_965,"00:46:02,254","00:46:07,717","Okay. Terrance and Phillip are supposed to be killed, and we think that sucks ass!"
632,966_967,"00:46:09,636","00:46:13,264",Yes? We were to understand there'd be pie and punch.
633,968,"00:46:13,348","00:46:14,348",There isn't any.
634,969_970_971_972,"00:46:14,433","00:46:25,651","Oh! Terrance and Phillip are supposed to be killed, so we think we should prank call a bunch of policemen and have pizza sent to them that they didn't order!"
635,973,"00:46:30,616","00:46:32,116",- May I? - What?
636,974_975,"00:46:32,701","00:46:36,245",Terrance and Phillip are currently being held at a Canadian internment camp two kilometers outside of town.
637,976_977,"00:46:36,330","00:46:39,290",They're to be executed tomorrow during a star-studded USO show for the troops.
638,978_979_980_981,"00:46:39,374","00:46:44,754","Tomorrow? Once the show begins, we should have about one hour to get Terrance and Phillip out of their cell and into this clearing."
639,982_983,"00:46:44,838","00:46:48,132","There, we will all rendezvous and, together, take Terrance and Phillip safely back to Canada."
640,984,"00:46:48,216","00:46:50,051","Wow, dude, Wendy's new guy is smart."
641,985,"00:46:50,135","00:46:52,803",You must all meet me at the rendezvous point at precisely 10:00 p.m.
642,986_987,"00:46:52,888","00:46:58,142","Sneaking into the show and breaking out Terrance and Phillip will be the most dangerous part, so I'll go myself."
643,988,"00:46:58,393","00:46:59,352",No! We're going!
644,989,"00:47:00,562","00:47:01,646",We started la R sistance.
645,990,"00:47:01,730","00:47:03,981",We'll get Terrance and Phillip and meet you at the rendezvous point.
646,991,"00:47:04,066","00:47:06,776",This will be very dangerous. Are you quite sure?
647,992,"00:47:06,860","00:47:07,985",Fuck that!
648,993,"00:47:08,070","00:47:09,654","Cartman, do you want that V-Chip in you forever?"
649,994,"00:47:09,738","00:47:11,947",We're going. Now let's run through the plan.
650,995,"00:47:22,376","00:47:24,585","Oh, boy! Military action, Ned!"
651,996,"00:47:24,670","00:47:27,463",Let's kill us some goddamn Australians!
652,997,"00:47:27,547","00:47:29,590",I think we're fighting Canadians.
653,998,"00:47:29,675","00:47:31,842","Canadians, Australians, what's the difference?"
654,999,"00:47:31,927","00:47:36,389","Yeah. This uniform makes me feel like a tough, brute man, Mr. Hat."
655,1000,"00:47:36,473","00:47:38,474","It sure does, Mr. Garrison."
656,1001_1002,"00:47:38,558","00:47:43,896","Oh, boy, I can't wait for our first shore leave so I can get me some fucking poontang."
657,1003,"00:47:43,980","00:47:44,980",Pay attention!
658,1004,"00:47:45,065","00:47:48,317",Tomorrow night is the USO show for all you troops!
659,1005,"00:47:48,402","00:47:51,862","There will be celebrities, followed by the execution of Terrance and Phillip."
660,1006,"00:47:53,615","00:47:57,910","After the show, we will finally be sending ground troops into Canada."
661,1007,"00:47:57,994","00:47:59,286",So let's strategize.
662,1008_1009_1010,"00:47:59,371","00:48:06,502","Map! Our sources have told us that the Canadians are preparing for our invasion, so we must use caution."
663,1011,"00:48:06,586","00:48:08,963",Each battalion has a specific code name and mission.
664,1012,"00:48:09,047","00:48:11,465","Battalion Five, raise your hands."
665,1013_1014,"00:48:11,550","00:48:16,721","You will be the all-important first attack wave, which we will call Operation Human Shield."
666,1015,"00:48:16,805","00:48:17,888","Hey, wait a minute!"
667,1016,"00:48:17,973","00:48:21,100","Now keep in mind, Operation Human Shield will suffer heavy losses."
668,1017,"00:48:21,184","00:48:22,685",Battalion Fourteen?
669,1018,"00:48:23,186","00:48:26,063",Right. You are Operation Get Behind the Darkies.
670,1019,"00:48:26,148","00:48:27,898",You will follow Battalion Five here.
671,1020,"00:48:27,983","00:48:31,736","And try not to get killed, for God's sake. Are there any questions, men?"
672,1021,"00:48:31,820","00:48:32,820","Yes, soldier?"
673,1022,"00:48:32,904","00:48:35,531",Have you ever heard of the Emancipation Proclamation?
674,1023,"00:48:35,615","00:48:37,199",I don't listen to hip-hop.
675,1024,"00:48:37,284","00:48:40,077","After that, we will march into the heart of Canada and we will..."
676,1025,"00:48:41,455","00:48:43,289",I'm coming to get you! I'm coming to get you!
677,1026,"00:48:43,373","00:48:45,666",What's wrong with this thing?
678,1027,"00:48:46,084","00:48:49,420",It's fucking Windows 98! Get Bill Gates in here!
679,1028_1029,"00:48:52,674","00:48:56,927",You told us Windows 98 would be faster and more efficient with better access to the Internet.
680,1030,"00:48:57,012","00:48:59,597",It is faster. Over five million...
681,1031,"00:49:00,307","00:49:04,101","All right, men, get lots of rest and prepare to go into Canada!"
682,1032,"00:49:07,856","00:49:10,357","After you have Terrance and Phillip, quietly make your way to this ridge."
683,1033_1034,"00:49:10,442","00:49:14,445","We will be waiting for you there. We cannot wait for long, so if you're not there at 10:00, we'll have to leave."
684,1035_1036,"00:49:14,529","00:49:18,407","- Got you. - You are indeed brave, but you will need help from someone who's done this sort of thing before."

703,1082,"00:51:31,875","00:51:34,251",It talks about how people communicate differently.
