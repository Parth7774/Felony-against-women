1,2,"00:04:22,138","00:04:25,580",State your business or prepare to get winged!
2,3,"00:04:26,309","00:04:28,787","Calm yourselves, gentlemen."
3,4,"00:04:28,853","00:04:30,530",I mean you no harm.
4,5,"00:04:31,356","00:04:34,362",I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
5,6,"00:04:34,707","00:04:35,889",Oh boy.
6,7,"00:04:37,678","00:04:39,416","Good cold evening, gentlemen."
7,8_9,"00:04:39,457","00:04:43,846",I'm looking for a pair of slave traders that go by the name of the Speck Brothers.
8,10,"00:04:43,989","00:04:45,074",Might that be you?
9,11,"00:04:46,913","00:04:47,999",Who wants to know?
10,12,"00:04:48,208","00:04:49,341","Well, I do."
11,13,"00:04:49,832","00:04:51,980","I'm Dr. King Schultz. This is my horse, Fritz."
12,14,"00:04:53,684","00:04:54,907",What kinda doctor?
13,15_16,"00:04:55,671","00:04:58,540","Dentist. Now, are you the Speck Brothers?"
14,17_18,"00:04:58,591","00:05:01,515",And did you purchase those men at the Greenville slave auction?
15,19,"00:05:01,552","00:05:02,353",So what?
16,20,"00:05:02,354","00:05:04,471",So I wish to parley with you.
17,21,"00:05:04,542","00:05:05,541",Speak English.
18,22,"00:05:06,214","00:05:07,257",Oh sorry.
19,23,"00:05:07,809","00:05:10,019",Please forgive me. It is a second language.
20,24_25,"00:05:10,186","00:05:15,914","Now, amongst your inventory, I've been led to believe, is a specimen I'm keen to acquire."
21,26,"00:05:16,437","00:05:17,897","Hello, you poor devils!"
22,27_28,"00:05:19,028","00:05:24,565",Is there one amongst you who was formerly a resident of the Carrucan plantation?
23,29,"00:05:26,014","00:05:27,799",I'm from the Carrucan plantation.
24,30,"00:05:29,924","00:05:30,803",Who said that?
25,31,"00:06:18,254","00:06:19,369",What's your name?
26,32_33,"00:06:23,801","00:06:28,335",Django. Then you are exactly the one I'm looking for.
27,34,"00:06:30,475","00:06:32,195",Do you know who the Brittle Brothers are?
28,35,"00:06:36,665","00:06:37,666",Who are they?
29,36,"00:06:39,882","00:06:40,828",Big John.
30,37_38_39,"00:06:42,153","00:06:47,165",Ellis. Roger. Sometime they call him...
31,40,"00:06:47,572","00:06:48,623",Lil Raj.
32,41,"00:06:50,203","00:06:52,328",They was overseers at the Carrucan plantation.
33,42,"00:06:52,580","00:06:53,664",Not anymore.
34,43,"00:06:56,837","00:06:57,794",Tell me...
35,44_45,"00:06:58,482","00:07:03,092","if you were to see any of these three gentlemen again, would you recognize them? Hey."
36,46,"00:07:04,284","00:07:05,665",Stop talking to him like that.
37,47,"00:07:05,864","00:07:06,714",Like What?
38,48,"00:07:07,296","00:07:08,245",Like that.
39,49,"00:07:08,568","00:07:11,216","My good man, I'm simply trying to ascertain..."
40,50,"00:07:11,218","00:07:12,394","Speak English, goddamn it."
41,51,"00:07:13,230","00:07:15,216",Everybody calm down.
42,52_53,"00:07:15,276","00:07:19,310","I'm simply a customer, trying to conduct a transaction."
43,54,"00:07:19,357","00:07:20,219",I don't care.
44,55,"00:07:20,487","00:07:21,984","No sale. Now, off with you."
45,56,"00:07:22,966","00:07:25,154",Don't be ridiculous. Of course they're for sale.
46,57,"00:07:25,879","00:07:26,920",Move it.
47,58_59_60,"00:07:27,805","00:07:36,056","My good man, did you simply get carried away with your dramatic gesture or are you pointing your weapon at me with lethal intention?"
48,61,"00:07:37,856","00:07:39,431","Last chance, fancy pants."
49,62,"00:07:40,878","00:07:42,504","Oh, very well."
50,63_64_65,"00:08:12,340","00:08:18,958","I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast, but I didn't want you to do anything rash before you had a moment to come to your senses."
51,66,"00:08:19,743","00:08:22,430",You goddamn son of a bitch!
52,67,"00:08:22,984","00:08:25,089",You shot Roscoe! Well...
53,68,"00:08:25,673","00:08:27,161",And you killed Ace!
54,69,"00:08:27,550","00:08:30,305",I only shot your brother once he threatened to shoot me.
55,70,"00:08:30,601","00:08:33,222","And I do believe I have... one, two, three, four..."
56,71_72,"00:08:33,529","00:08:36,350","five witnesses, who can attest to that fact."
57,73,"00:08:36,702","00:08:38,357",Damn leg's busted!
58,74,"00:08:38,444","00:08:39,481",No doubt.
59,75_76,"00:08:39,671","00:08:45,405","Now, if you could keep your caterwauling down to a minimum, I'd like to finish my line of inquiry with young Django."
60,77,"00:08:49,614","00:08:51,689",God-fucking-damn it!
61,78,"00:08:51,691","00:08:52,662",As I was saying...
62,79_80,"00:08:53,413","00:08:57,125","if you were to see the Brittle Brothers, again you could recognize them?"
63,81_82,"00:08:57,622","00:09:00,924",Yeah. Sold American!
64,83,"00:09:00,958","00:09:02,177","So, Mr. Speck?"
65,84,"00:09:02,178","00:09:04,579",Mr. Speck? How much for young Django here?
66,85,"00:09:10,366","00:09:12,595",That iron is nasty business.
67,86,"00:09:18,222","00:09:19,910","Oh, could you hold this for a moment?"
68,87,"00:09:22,313","00:09:23,347",Thank you.
69,88_89,"00:09:23,348","00:09:25,579",Django? Get up on that horse.
70,90_91,"00:09:26,278","00:09:31,896","Also, if I were you, I'd take that winter coat the dear departed Speck left behind."
71,92_93,"00:09:46,128","00:09:49,683",Nigger! Don't you touch my brother's coat.
72,94,"00:10:01,539","00:10:03,035",Goddamn it!
73,95,"00:10:07,772","00:10:09,098",One hundred...
74,96_97_98,"00:10:09,651","00:10:14,448",ten... 20... and five...
75,99,"00:10:15,935","00:10:17,102",for young Django here.
76,100_101,"00:10:17,233","00:10:21,835","And since he won't be needing it anymore, I'd like to purchase your brother's nag."
77,102_103_104,"00:10:22,698","00:10:27,545","Also, Mr. Speck, I'm afraid I will require a bill of sale."
78,105,"00:10:27,712","00:10:28,635",Do you have one?
79,106,"00:10:29,858","00:10:31,860","You go to hell, dentist."
80,107,"00:10:32,968","00:10:33,952",I thought not.
81,108,"00:10:34,930","00:10:35,925",No worries.
82,109,"00:10:36,678","00:10:37,886",I come prepared.
83,110,"00:10:42,482","00:10:43,416",Thank you.
84,111_112,"00:10:44,429","00:10:47,779","This will serve nicely, as a bill of sale."
85,113,"00:11:05,609","00:11:08,434","Now, as to you poor devils."
86,114_115_116,"00:11:09,567","00:11:15,908","So, as I see it, when it comes to the subject of what to do next, you gentlemen have..."
87,117,"00:11:15,909","00:11:17,038",two choices.
88,118_119_120_121,"00:11:17,507","00:11:24,477","One. Once I'm gone, you could lift that beast off the remaining Speck, then carry him to the nearest town."
89,122,"00:11:24,747","00:11:27,937",Which would be at least 37 miles back the way you came.
90,123,"00:11:28,535","00:11:29,340",Or two.
91,124_125_126_127_128,"00:11:30,699","00:11:40,493","You could unshackle yourselves, take that rifle, put a bullet in his head, bury the two of them deep, and then make your way to a more enlightened area of this country."
92,129,"00:11:41,694","00:11:42,709",Choice is yours.
93,130_131,"00:11:43,591","00:11:49,973","And on the off chance there are any astronomy aficionados amongst you, the North Star is that one."
94,132_133,"00:11:52,055","00:12:11,476","Tada. Now wait a minute, fellas."
95,134,"00:12:11,645","00:12:13,305",Let's talk about this!
96,135,"00:12:17,613","00:12:20,907",You got to be reasonable in a situation like this!
97,136,"00:12:22,493","00:12:25,496",I'm not a bad guy. I'm just doing my job!
98,137_138,"00:12:25,663","00:12:29,104","Blueberry, didn't I give you my last apple?"
99,139,"00:12:29,660","00:12:30,699","Tell you what, boys."
100,140_141,"00:12:30,916","00:12:34,263","Take me to the doc in El Paso, I'll get you your freedom."
101,142,"00:12:34,903","00:12:36,357","No. No, please..."
102,143,"00:13:23,846","00:13:25,222","Alright, now."
103,144_145,"00:13:25,389","00:13:29,485","I'd like you to take two of these tonight, and then in the morning..."
104,146,"00:13:32,208","00:13:33,558",That's a nigger on a horse.
105,147,"00:13:59,518","00:14:00,935",What's everybody staring at?
106,148,"00:14:01,461","00:14:03,481",They ain't never seen no nigger on a horse before.
107,149,"00:14:27,117","00:14:28,861","Good morning, innkeeper!"
108,150,"00:14:30,698","00:14:32,776",Two beers for two weary travelers.
109,151,"00:14:32,944","00:14:34,833",It's still a bit early.
110,152,"00:14:35,191","00:14:37,141",We won't be open for another hour.
111,153,"00:14:37,797","00:14:39,494","By then, we'll be serving breakfast."
112,154,"00:14:42,646","00:14:44,906","What the hell you think you're doing, boy?"
113,155,"00:14:45,177","00:14:46,786",Get that nigger outta here!
114,156,"00:14:52,270","00:14:54,075",Help! Help!
115,157_158_159,"00:14:54,140","00:14:58,350","Innkeeper! Remember, get the sheriff, not the marshal."
116,160,"00:14:58,710","00:15:00,357",Sheriff! Help!
117,161_162,"00:15:00,835","00:15:05,906",Alas. Now we must act as our own bartender.
118,163,"00:15:08,325","00:15:09,873","Sit down, my boy."
119,164,"00:15:20,019","00:15:21,348",What kind of dentist are you?
120,165,"00:15:23,465","00:15:28,053","Despite that cart, I haven't practiced dentistry in five years."
121,166,"00:15:32,987","00:15:35,192","But these days, I practice a new profession..."
122,167,"00:15:38,461","00:15:39,503",bounty hunter.
123,168,"00:15:46,374","00:15:47,882",Do you know what a bounty hunter is?
124,169_170_171_172,"00:15:48,699","00:15:59,223","No. Well... the way the slave trade deals in human lives for cash, a bounty hunter deals in corpses."
125,173_174_175,"00:16:00,713","00:16:18,104",Hat. Prost. The state places a bounty on a man's head.
126,176,"00:16:18,187","00:16:21,184","I track that man, I find that man, I kill that man."
127,177,"00:16:21,186","00:16:25,190","After I've killed him, I transport that man's corpse back to the authorities."
128,178,"00:16:25,575","00:16:27,700",Sometimes that's easier said than done.
129,179_180_181,"00:16:27,905","00:16:35,197","I show that corpse to the authorities, proving yes, indeed, I truly have killed him, at which point the authorities pay me the bounty."
130,182_183,"00:16:35,913","00:16:39,573","So, like slavery, it's a flesh for cash business."
131,184,"00:16:40,876","00:16:41,924",What's a bounty?
132,185,"00:16:45,673","00:16:47,132",It's like a reward.
133,186,"00:16:47,798","00:16:48,904",You kill people?
134,187,"00:16:49,261","00:16:50,399",And they give you a reward?
135,188,"00:16:51,399","00:16:52,721","Certain people, yeah."
136,189,"00:16:53,106","00:16:54,058",Bad people?
137,190,"00:16:55,530","00:16:57,306","Badder they are, bigger the reward."
138,191,"00:16:58,443","00:16:59,777",Which brings me to you.
139,192,"00:17:00,771","00:17:03,993","And I must admit, I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes to you."
140,193,"00:17:05,431","00:17:07,611","On one hand, I despise slavery."
141,194_195,"00:17:07,937","00:17:11,219","On the other hand, I need your help."
142,196,"00:17:11,221","00:17:13,771","If you're not in a position to refuse, all the better."
143,197_198,"00:17:15,425","00:17:19,522","So, for the time being, I'm gonna make this slavery malarkey work to my benefit."
144,199_200_201,"00:17:20,541","00:17:25,118","Still, having said that, I feel guilty."
145,202_203,"00:17:26,944","00:17:32,136","So, I would like the two of us to enter into an agreement."
146,204,"00:17:39,371","00:17:40,964",I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.
147,205_206_207,"00:17:45,785","00:17:51,877","However, at this endeavor, I'm at a slight disadvantage, insofar as I don't know what they look like."
148,208,"00:17:53,900","00:17:54,902",But you do.
149,209,"00:17:55,730","00:17:56,452",Don't ya?
150,210,"00:17:57,019","00:17:58,617",I know what they look like alright.
151,211_212,"00:17:59,188","00:18:01,982",Good. So here's my agreement.
152,213,"00:18:02,868","00:18:05,673",You travel with me until we find them. Where we going?
153,214_215,"00:18:06,323","00:18:10,423","I hear at least two of them are overseeing up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where."
154,216_217,"00:18:11,468","00:18:15,764",That means we visit every plantation in Gatlinburg till we find them.
155,218_219_220,"00:18:15,846","00:18:20,732","And when we find them, you point them out, and I kill them."
156,221_222_223,"00:18:22,258","00:18:28,365","You do that, I agree to give you your freedom, $25 per Brittle Brother."
157,224,"00:18:28,366","00:18:29,678",That's $75.
158,225_226,"00:18:30,171","00:18:33,697","And as if on cue, here comes the sheriff."
159,227,"00:18:41,455","00:18:43,090","Ok, boys."
160,228,"00:18:43,394","00:18:44,484",Fun's over.
161,229,"00:18:45,862","00:18:46,838",Come on out.
162,230_231,"00:18:50,509","00:18:54,176","Alright folks, calm down."
163,232,"00:18:55,219","00:18:56,670",Go about your business.
164,233,"00:18:58,123","00:18:59,998",These jokers will be gone soon.
165,234_235,"00:19:02,167","00:19:06,675","Now, why you all wanna come into my town and start trouble?"
166,236,"00:19:08,820","00:19:10,768",Scare all these nice people.
167,237_238_239,"00:19:12,248","00:19:20,684","You ain't got nothing better to do, than to come into Bill Sharp's town and show your ass?"
168,240,"00:19:29,366","00:19:31,098",What'd you just do to our sheriff?
169,241,"00:19:44,234","00:19:45,910",Now you can get the marshal.
170,242_243_244,"00:19:48,083","00:19:51,648",Marshal! Marshal! Should we wait inside?
171,245,"00:19:51,754","00:19:52,751",Can we just leave?
172,246,"00:19:52,860","00:19:53,707",After you.
173,247,"00:19:56,652","00:20:00,168",Move that buckboard a long ways across the street from the saloon.
174,248,"00:20:00,909","00:20:03,236","I want six men, six rifles behind it."
175,249,"00:20:04,085","00:20:06,326","I want two men, two rifles up on this roof."
176,250,"00:20:06,446","00:20:08,114","Two men, two rifles on that roof."
177,251,"00:20:08,792","00:20:10,976",All the barrels aimed at that front door.
178,252,"00:20:12,225","00:20:14,753",Somebody get poor Bill outta the goddamn street.
179,253,"00:20:16,091","00:20:17,223",You in the saloon!
180,254,"00:20:18,692","00:20:21,528",We got a hundred rifles aimed at every way out of that building.
181,255,"00:20:22,565","00:20:25,029",You got one chance to get out of this alive.
182,256_257,"00:20:26,476","00:20:30,658","You and your nigger come out right now with your hands over your head, and I mean right now."
183,258,"00:20:32,232","00:20:35,652",Is this the marshal I have the pleasure of addressing?
184,259,"00:20:36,253","00:20:37,230","Yes, it is."
185,260,"00:20:37,993","00:20:39,865",This is U.S. Marshal Gill Tatum.
186,261,"00:20:40,274","00:20:42,023","Na wunderbar, marshal."
187,262_263_264_265_266,"00:20:42,826","00:20:56,362","I have relieved myself of all weapons, and just as you have instructed, I am ready to step outside with my hands, raised above my head."
188,267_268_269_270_271,"00:20:57,949","00:21:12,648","I trust as a representative of the criminal justice system of the United States of America, I shan't be shot down in the street by either you or your deputies before I've had my day in court."
189,272,"00:21:13,119","00:21:14,680",You mean like you did our sheriff.
190,273,"00:21:15,317","00:21:17,110",Shot him down like a dog in the street.
191,274,"00:21:17,277","00:21:19,613","Yes, that's exactly what I mean."
192,275_276,"00:21:19,780","00:21:25,300","Do I have your word as a lawman, not to shoot me down like a dog in the street?"
193,277_278_279,"00:21:28,789","00:21:35,086","Well, much as we'd all enjoy seeing something like that, ain't nobody gonna cheat the hangman in my town."
194,280,"00:21:36,371","00:21:37,719","Fair enough, marshal."
195,281,"00:21:37,861","00:21:38,962",Here we come.
196,282,"00:21:40,925","00:21:43,005",They're a little tense out there.
197,283,"00:21:43,464","00:21:46,632","So don't make any quick movements, and let me do the talking."
198,284,"00:21:48,611","00:21:49,609",Come ahead.
199,285,"00:21:56,900","00:21:57,994",You unarmed?
200,286,"00:21:58,318","00:21:59,479","Yes, indeed we are."
201,287_288_289_290,"00:22:00,779","00:22:08,665","Marshal Tatum, may I address you and your deputies, and apparently the entire town of Daughtrey, as to the incident that just occurred?"
202,291,"00:22:10,080","00:22:11,150",Go on. Thank you.
203,292,"00:22:12,995","00:22:15,138",My name is Dr. King Schultz.
204,293,"00:22:15,248","00:22:18,183","Like yourself marshal, I'm a servant of the court."
205,294_295_296_297_298,"00:22:18,697","00:22:33,603","The man lying dead in the dirt, who the good people of Daughtrey saw fit to elect as their sheriff, who went by the name of Bill Sharp, is actually a wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck, with a price on his head of $200."
206,299,"00:22:33,863","00:22:36,468","Now that's $200, dead or alive."
207,300,"00:22:37,087","00:22:38,233",The hell you say!
208,301,"00:22:38,754","00:22:42,260",I'm aware this is probably disconcerting news.
209,302_303_304,"00:22:42,768","00:22:48,109","But I'm willing to wager, this man was elected sheriff sometime in the past two years?"
210,305_306_307,"00:22:49,839","00:22:54,888","Yeah. I know this, because three years ago, he was rustling cattle from the B.C."
211,308,"00:22:54,889","00:22:57,586","Corrigan Cattle Company of Lubbock, Texas."
212,309_310_311_312,"00:22:58,110","00:23:07,085","Now this, is a warrant, made out by Circuit Court Judge, Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas."
213,313,"00:23:07,734","00:23:09,262",You're encouraged to wire him.
214,314_315,"00:23:09,510","00:23:14,071","He'll back up who I am, and who your dear departed sheriff was."
215,316_317,"00:23:22,816","00:23:26,457","In other words marshal, you owe me $200."
216,318,"00:23:35,248","00:23:36,496",I'll be damned.
217,319_320_321_322,"00:24:05,086","00:24:14,203","After this Brittle business is behind us, you'll be a free man, with a horse, $75 in your back pocket..."
218,323,"00:24:17,006","00:24:18,291",What's your plan after that?
219,324_325,"00:24:20,802","00:24:24,256","Find my wife, and buy her freedom."
220,326_327,"00:24:26,790","00:24:31,198","Django, I had no idea you were a married man."
221,328,"00:24:32,383","00:24:34,307",Do most slaves believe in marriage?
222,329,"00:24:35,953","00:24:37,166",Me and my wife do.
223,330,"00:24:38,376","00:24:40,165","Old Man Carrucan didn't, that's why were."
224,331,"00:24:41,450","00:24:42,271",We run off.
225,332_333,"00:24:43,724","00:24:47,770","Django. Django, Django."
226,334,"00:24:48,529","00:24:50,783","You got sand, Django."
227,335,"00:24:52,214","00:24:53,698",Boy's got sand.
228,336,"00:24:55,935","00:24:58,806",I got no use for a nigger with sand.
229,337,"00:25:00,584","00:25:03,671",I want you to burn a runaway R right here on his cheek.
230,338,"00:25:04,488","00:25:05,531","And the girl, too."
231,339_340,"00:25:07,424","00:25:12,058","And I want you to take them to the Greenville auction, and sell them."
232,341,"00:25:13,054","00:25:14,049",Both of them.
233,342_343,"00:25:15,267","00:25:20,471",Separately. And this one...
234,344,"00:25:23,273","00:25:25,424",you will sell him cheap.
235,345,"00:25:27,944","00:25:29,265",In Greenville...
236,346,"00:25:32,161","00:25:34,953",there should be some sort of a records office.
237,347,"00:25:42,268","00:25:43,898",You know when she was sold...
238,348_349,"00:25:45,939","00:25:50,420","you know where she came from, and you know her name."
239,350,"00:25:51,688","00:25:52,732",What is her name?
240,351_352_353_354_355,"00:25:53,880","00:26:05,463",Broomhilda. What? Broom-hilda. Broomhilda? Were her owners German?
241,356,"00:26:06,021","00:26:07,067","Yeah, how you know?"
242,357,"00:26:08,095","00:26:09,856",She wasn't born on the Carrucan plantation.
243,358_359,"00:26:09,858","00:26:12,097","She was raised by a German mistress, the Von Shafts."
244,360,"00:26:12,383","00:26:13,747","She speak a little German, too."
245,361,"00:26:14,491","00:26:15,963",Your wife?
246,362_363,"00:26:16,510","00:26:19,607","When she was little, her mistress taught her so she'd have somebody to speak German with."
247,364,"00:26:21,581","00:26:23,456","Well, let me get this straight."
248,365_366,"00:26:24,334","00:26:28,922","Your slave wife speaks German, and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?"
249,367_368,"00:26:29,089","00:26:35,971",Yep. They call me Hilda.
250,369_370,"00:26:53,697","00:26:59,050","When we gain access to these plantations, we'll be putting on an act."
251,371,"00:27:00,620","00:27:02,940",You'll be playing a character.
252,372_373_374,"00:27:12,294","00:27:24,763","No? During the act, you can never break character."
253,375,"00:27:26,288","00:27:27,292",Do you understand?
254,376_377,"00:27:28,356","00:27:30,900",Yeah. Don't break character.
255,378,"00:27:33,396","00:27:36,661",And your character is that of The Valet.
256,379,"00:27:37,907","00:27:38,837",What that is?
257,380,"00:27:40,461","00:27:42,223",That's a fancy word for servant.
258,381_382_383,"00:27:42,871","00:27:49,752","Valet? And now Django, you may choose your character's costume."
259,384,"00:27:52,624","00:27:54,459",Youse gonna let me pick out my own clothes?
260,385,"00:27:54,549","00:27:55,732",But of course.
261,386,"00:28:29,954","00:28:33,634",It's against the law for niggers to ride horses in this territory.
262,387,"00:28:33,822","00:28:36,372",This is my valet. My valet does not walk.
263,388,"00:28:37,294","00:28:41,164",I said niggers on horses... His name is Django.
264,389,"00:28:41,214","00:28:42,503",He's a free man.
265,390,"00:28:42,504","00:28:44,009",He can ride what he pleases.
266,391,"00:28:44,099","00:28:45,439",Not on my property.
267,392,"00:28:45,887","00:28:47,560","Not around my niggers, he can't."
268,393_394,"00:28:48,444","00:28:52,932","My good sir, perhaps we got off on the wrong boot."
269,395,"00:28:53,400","00:28:55,753",Allow me to unring this bell.
270,396,"00:28:56,229","00:28:58,161",My name is Dr. King Schultz.
271,397,"00:28:58,224","00:28:59,864","This is my valet, Django."
272,398,"00:29:00,031","00:29:02,226","And these are our horses, Tony and Fritz."
273,399,"00:29:05,995","00:29:06,992",Mr. Bennett?
274,400_401_402,"00:29:07,539","00:29:12,289","I've been led to believe, that you are a gentleman, and a businessman."
275,403_404,"00:29:12,446","00:29:17,694",And it is for these attributes we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee to parley with you now.
276,405,"00:29:19,105","00:29:22,297",I wish to purchase one of your nigger gals.
277,406_407_408,"00:29:24,639","00:29:29,686","You and your Jimmie, rode from Texas to Tennessee to buy one of my nigger gals?"
278,409,"00:29:30,013","00:29:31,396","No appointment, no nothing?"
279,410,"00:29:31,986","00:29:33,402","Oh, I'm afraid so."
280,411,"00:29:34,021","00:29:36,293","Well, what if I was to say I don't like you?"
281,412,"00:29:36,660","00:29:38,167",Or your fancy-pants nigger?
282,413,"00:29:38,272","00:29:40,281",And I would not sell you a tinker's damn.
283,414,"00:29:41,149","00:29:42,635",Now what you got to say about that?
284,415,"00:29:45,923","00:29:47,154",Mr. Bennett.
285,416_417_418,"00:29:48,361","00:29:56,282","If you are the businessman I've been led to believe you to be, I have, 5,000 things I might say that could change your mind."
286,419,"00:30:00,906","00:30:04,130","Well, come on inside and get yourself something cool to drink."
287,420_421_422_423,"00:30:18,735","00:30:26,097","Oh, maybe, while we discuss business, you could provide one of your loveliest black creatures to escort Django here around your magnificent grounds."
288,424,"00:30:26,117","00:30:27,470","Oh, well, absolutely."
289,425_426,"00:30:27,960","00:30:29,626","Betina. Yessir, Big Daddy?"
290,427,"00:30:30,496","00:30:31,861",What's your Jimmie's name again?
291,428,"00:30:32,415","00:30:33,917",Django. Django.
292,429_430_431,"00:30:34,083","00:30:39,513","Betina sugar, could you take Django there and take him around the grounds here and show him all the pretty stuff."
293,432,"00:30:39,962","00:30:41,255","As you please, Big Daddy."
294,433_434_435,"00:30:41,257","00:30:45,343","Oh, Mr. Bennett, I must remind you, Django is a free man."
295,436,"00:30:45,345","00:30:47,147",He cannot be treated like a slave.
296,437_438,"00:30:47,148","00:30:51,219","He... within the bounds of good taste, he must be treated as an extension of myself."
297,439,"00:30:51,712","00:30:52,881","Understood, Schultz."
298,440,"00:30:52,882","00:30:54,521","Betina, sugar? Yes'm?"
299,441,"00:30:54,687","00:30:56,687",Django isn't a slave.
300,442,"00:30:57,297","00:30:59,317","Django is a free man, you understand?"
301,443_444,"00:31:00,714","00:31:05,245","You can't treat him like any of the other niggers around here, because he ain't like any of the other niggers around here."
302,445,"00:31:05,246","00:31:06,047",You got it?
303,446,"00:31:06,407","00:31:08,727",You want I should treat him like white folks?
304,447_448,"00:31:09,264","00:31:12,247",No. That's not what I said.
305,449,"00:31:12,512","00:31:14,401","Then I don't know what you want, Big Daddy."
306,450_451,"00:31:15,458","00:31:17,850","Yes, I can see that."
307,452_453,"00:31:20,581","00:31:24,066",What's the name of that peckerwood boy from town that works with the glass?
308,454,"00:31:24,984","00:31:26,719",His mama work over at the lumberyard.
309,455,"00:31:27,142","00:31:28,279","Oh, you mean Jerry."
310,456,"00:31:28,280","00:31:29,894",That's the boy's name. Jerry!
311,457,"00:31:30,074","00:31:31,472","You know Jerry, don't you, sugar?"
312,458,"00:31:31,474","00:31:32,670","Yes'm, Big Daddy."
313,459,"00:31:33,115","00:31:34,310","Well, that's it, then."
314,460,"00:31:35,057","00:31:37,303",You just treat him like you would Jerry.
315,461,"00:31:44,531","00:31:47,490",That house we just left from is The Big House.
316,462,"00:31:47,769","00:31:50,225",Big Daddy call it that because it's big.
317,463,"00:31:51,661","00:31:53,959",That there is the pantry.
318,464,"00:31:54,162","00:31:56,790",That's where Big Daddy hang all his dead meat.
319,465,"00:31:57,737","00:31:59,199",Po' little squirrels.
320,466,"00:32:01,421","00:32:02,965",What you do for your massa?
321,467,"00:32:04,177","00:32:05,978",Didn't you hear him tell you I ain't no slave?
322,468,"00:32:06,034","00:32:08,453","So you really free? Yes, I's free."
323,469,"00:32:08,511","00:32:10,584",You mean you wanna dress like that?
324,470,"00:32:12,986","00:32:14,278","Betina, I need to ask you something."
325,471,"00:32:14,279","00:32:15,388",What you want?
326,472,"00:32:15,390","00:32:17,226",I'm looking for three white men.
327,473,"00:32:17,468","00:32:18,717",Three brothers. Overseers.

459,655,"00:44:08,611","00:44:10,093",I didn't say no bags.

495,696,"00:46:41,246","00:46:42,147",Do you know it?
496,697,"00:46:42,515","00:46:44,318","Oh, every German knows that story."
497,698,"00:46:50,976","00:46:52,352",Would you like me to tell you?
498,699_700_701,"00:46:53,972","00:46:58,160","Well, Broomhilda, was a..."
499,702_703_704,"00:46:58,785","00:47:05,733","princess. She was a daughter of Wotan, god of all gods."
500,705_706,"00:47:06,825","00:47:10,037","Anyway, her father is really mad at her."
501,707,"00:47:10,204","00:47:11,189",What she do?
502,708,"00:47:12,531","00:47:13,991",I can't exactly remember.
503,709,"00:47:14,041","00:47:16,236",She disobeys him in some way.
504,710,"00:47:16,877","00:47:19,863",So he puts her on top of the mountain.
505,711,"00:47:20,714","00:47:21,840",Broomhilda's on a mountain?
506,712_713,"00:47:22,007","00:47:25,817","It's a German legend, there is always going to be a mountain in there somewhere."
507,714,"00:47:26,386","00:47:30,114",And he puts a fire-breathing dragon there to guard the mountain.
508,715_716,"00:47:32,100","00:47:36,890","And he surrounds her, in a circle of hellfire."
509,717_718,"00:47:38,649","00:47:42,662","And there, Broomhilda shall remain."
510,719_720,"00:47:44,279","00:47:49,339","Unless, a hero arises brave enough to save her."
511,721,"00:47:50,661","00:47:51,886",Does a fella arise?
512,722_723,"00:47:52,412","00:47:55,234","Yes Django, as a matter of fact he does."
513,724,"00:47:55,541","00:47:57,584",A fella named Siegfried.
514,725,"00:47:58,293","00:47:59,571",Does Siegfried save her?
515,726,"00:48:01,971","00:48:03,812",Quite spectacularly so.
516,727_728,"00:48:05,133","00:48:09,263","He scales the mountain, because he's not afraid of it."
517,729_730,"00:48:10,103","00:48:13,483","He slays the dragon, because he's not afraid of him."
518,731,"00:48:14,445","00:48:16,578",And he walks through hellfire...
519,732,"00:48:19,280","00:48:20,993",because Broomhilda's worth it.
520,733,"00:48:25,654","00:48:26,925",I know how he feel.
521,734,"00:48:28,782","00:48:31,183",I think I'm just starting to realize that.
522,735_736_737,"00:48:37,165","00:48:41,026","Now, look, Django..."
523,738,"00:48:44,411","00:48:47,981",I don't doubt that one day you'll save your lady love...
524,739,"00:48:49,225","00:48:52,561",but I can't let you go to Greenville in a good conscience.
525,740_741,"00:48:54,222","00:48:58,229",A slave auction town in Mississippi isn't the place for you to visit.
526,742_743,"00:48:58,687","00:49:01,183","Free or not, it's just too dangerous."
527,744,"00:49:04,682","00:49:06,225",But let me ask you a question.
528,745,"00:49:14,202","00:49:16,208",How do you like the bounty hunting business?
529,746,"00:49:18,333","00:49:20,044",Kill white folks and they pay you for it?
530,747,"00:49:21,410","00:49:22,365",What's not to like?
531,748,"00:49:22,794","00:49:24,970","Now I have to admit, we make a good team."
532,749,"00:49:25,535","00:49:27,930",I thought you was mad at me for killing Big John and Lil Raj.
533,750_751,"00:49:28,375","00:49:32,140","Yeah, on that occasion you were a tad overzealous, but normally, that's a good thing."
534,752,"00:49:33,473","00:49:35,684",How'd you like to partner up for the winter?
535,753,"00:49:35,985","00:49:37,113",What you mean partner up?
536,754,"00:49:38,186","00:49:41,721",You work with me through the winter till the snow melts...
537,755,"00:49:43,332","00:49:45,483",I give you a third of my bounties.
538,756_757_758_759,"00:49:46,443","00:49:56,388","So we make some money this winter, and when the snow melts, I'll take you to Greenville myself, and we'll find where they sent your wife."
539,760,"00:50:01,083","00:50:02,586",Why you care what happen to me?
540,761,"00:50:04,703","00:50:06,140",Why you care if I find my wife?
541,762_763,"00:50:06,713","00:50:12,260",Frankly... I've never given anybody their freedom before.
542,764_765,"00:50:12,473","00:50:16,033","And now that I have, I feel vaguely responsible for you."
543,766,"00:50:17,516","00:50:20,765","Plus when a German meets a real life Siegfried, that's kind of a big deal."
544,767_768,"00:50:23,772","00:50:28,952","As a German, I'm obliged to help you on your quest to rescue your beloved Broomhilda."
545,769,"00:52:38,794","00:52:39,795",You got her.
546,770,"00:52:47,840","00:52:50,795",What happened to Mr. I Wanna Shoot White Folks For Money?
547,771,"00:52:51,628","00:52:52,889",His son's with him.
548,772,"00:52:53,218","00:52:54,132","Well, good."
549,773,"00:52:54,669","00:52:56,055",He'll have a loved one with him.
550,774,"00:52:56,375","00:52:58,430",Maybe even share a last word.
551,775,"00:53:00,762","00:53:02,623",That's better than most of them get.
552,776,"00:53:02,973","00:53:04,754",Damn sight better than he deserves.
553,777,"00:53:13,333","00:53:14,551",Put down the rifle.
554,778,"00:53:17,521","00:53:19,040","Don't worry, I'm not mad at you."
555,779,"00:53:20,156","00:53:22,491",Let's take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.
556,780,"00:53:26,580","00:53:27,885",Read it aloud.
557,781,"00:53:28,957","00:53:30,750",Consider that today's lesson.
558,782,"00:53:33,278","00:53:35,483",Wanted. Dead or alive.

563,788_789_790_791,"00:53:53,353","00:53:58,564","Thousand. Seven thousand Dollars, for Smitty Bacall."
564,792_793,"00:53:58,945","00:54:02,936",One... thousand and five hundred dollars for...
565,794,"00:54:03,101","00:54:04,042",each of his...

567,797,"00:54:09,748","00:54:14,004",Known members of the Smitty Bacall Gang are as follas.

569,799_800,"00:54:16,758","00:54:19,542","Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash and..."
570,801,"00:54:21,480","00:54:22,568",Crazy Craig Koons.
571,802,"00:54:24,220","00:54:25,239",That is...
572,803,"00:54:25,489","00:54:26,577",who Smitty Bacall is.
573,804_805,"00:54:27,164","00:54:31,744","If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at 22, they would never have printed that."
574,806_807,"00:54:32,354","00:54:38,466",But Smitty Bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches and he didn't mind killing people to do it.
575,808_809,"00:54:39,331","00:54:42,414","Do you want to save your wife, by doing what I do?"
576,810,"00:54:43,779","00:54:44,955",This is what I do.
577,811_812,"00:54:45,381","00:54:48,570","I kill people, and sell their corpses for cash."
578,813,"00:54:49,855","00:54:52,800","This corpse is worth $7,000."
579,814,"00:54:53,667","00:54:55,766",Now quit your pussyfooting and shoot him.
580,815_816_817_818,"00:55:06,012","00:55:21,319",Pa? Pa! Here. You need to keep this Smitty Bacall handbill.
581,819_820,"00:55:21,486","00:55:23,388",Why? It's good luck.
582,821,"00:55:23,738","00:55:26,024",You always keep the handbill of your first bounty.
583,822,"00:56:14,456","00:56:16,006",That's accurate.
584,823_824,"00:57:24,192","00:57:26,994","Doctor, Django, how the hell are you?"
585,825,"00:57:28,556","00:57:30,095",Who the hell-a you got there?
586,826,"00:57:30,863","00:57:32,453",The Wilson-Lowe Gang.
587,827,"00:57:33,085","00:57:35,701",Who the hell is the Wilson-Lowe Gang?
588,828_829,"00:57:36,762","00:57:41,044",Bad Chuck Wilson and meaner Bobby Lowe and three of their acolytes.
589,830,"00:57:42,808","00:57:45,089","Well, just leave them out here, they ain't going nowhere."
590,831_832,"00:57:45,308","00:57:49,021",Why don't you come in then out of the snowy snow and get yourselves some coffee.
591,833,"00:57:49,592","00:57:52,137",We had a birthday yesterday. Got some cake.
592,834,"00:57:52,591","00:57:53,636",Pretty good.
593,835,"00:58:27,172","00:58:28,423",Keep moving.
594,836,"00:58:28,590","00:58:30,550",Get on up on that auction block.
595,837,"00:58:32,093","00:58:34,470",Don't let that mud slow you down. Keep going.
596,838,"00:58:50,904","00:58:52,155",Keep going!
597,839,"00:58:54,616","00:58:56,418",Broomhilda Von Shaft.
598,840,"00:58:56,662","00:58:57,927",Age 27.
599,841,"00:58:58,703","00:59:00,121",'R' on right cheek.
600,842,"00:59:01,927","00:59:04,042",Calvin Candie.
601,843,"00:59:04,302","00:59:07,565",He owns the fourth biggest cotton plantation in Mississippi.
602,844_845_846,"00:59:07,566","00:59:11,602","Candyland. Candyland? Oh, so you've heard of it."
603,847,"00:59:11,642","00:59:13,316",Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.
604,848,"00:59:13,801","00:59:16,163","Well apparently, that's where your wife is..."
605,849,"00:59:16,638","00:59:19,182",and that's the repellant gentleman who owns her.
606,850,"00:59:19,613","00:59:22,043","Let's just hope she works in the house, not in the field."
607,851,"00:59:22,294","00:59:23,663","Oh, no, she ain't no field nigger."
608,852,"00:59:24,479","00:59:26,175",She... She pretty.
609,853,"00:59:27,335","00:59:28,787","And she talk good, too."
610,854,"00:59:30,652","00:59:32,493",But when they tore her back up and then they...
611,855,"00:59:33,834","00:59:35,439",burned that runaway r on her cheek...
612,856,"00:59:37,242","00:59:38,409",they goddamned her.
613,857_858,"00:59:43,122","00:59:46,016",She ain't no field nigger but she ain't good enough for the house no more either.
614,859,"00:59:46,834","00:59:48,399",They gonna try to make her a comfort girl.
615,860,"00:59:48,497","00:59:49,469",What's a comfort?
616,861,"00:59:51,089","00:59:52,516",Not while I got freedom.
617,862,"00:59:53,967","00:59:55,440",Not while I got my gun.
618,863,"00:59:58,846","01:00:00,360",So do we offer to buy her?
619,864_865_866_867,"01:00:03,340","01:00:12,680","So... say... a man, wants to buy a horse."
620,868,"01:00:13,243","01:00:14,884",Needs to buy a horse.
621,869_870_871,"01:00:16,529","01:00:21,395","He walks up to the farmer's farm, and he knocks on the farmer's door and asks the farmer to buy his horse."
622,872,"01:00:21,397","01:00:23,191",And do you know what the farmer says?
623,873,"01:00:23,288","01:00:25,239","The farmer says, no."
624,874_875,"01:00:27,115","01:00:31,358","Well, I say fuck that farmer, and I'm stealing that horse."
625,876_877,"01:00:32,130","01:00:36,385","Fair enough. But now you're a horse thief, and they hang horse thieves."
626,878_879,"01:00:36,591","01:00:40,511","Not to mention the horse goes back to its original owner, because the horse is still his property."
627,880_881,"01:00:40,778","01:00:43,073","We need her, and..."
628,882,"01:00:43,321","01:00:44,407",we need a bill of sale.
629,883,"01:00:44,559","01:00:46,512","Well, if we ain't gonna try to buy her, then how we gonna get her?"
630,884,"01:00:48,183","01:00:51,609",May I offer an alternative plan of action?
631,885,"01:00:51,777","01:00:52,872",Go ahead.
632,886_887_888_889,"01:00:53,659","01:00:59,778","So... the man, walks up to the farmer's farm, he knocks on the farmer's door..."
633,890_891_892,"01:01:00,540","01:01:05,536","and asks, not to buy the horse, but the farm."
634,893_894,"01:01:05,538","01:01:12,025","And makes an offer so ridiculous, the farmer is forced to say yes."
635,895,"01:01:12,878","01:01:14,675",We gonna offer to buy Candyland?
636,896,"01:01:14,676","01:01:15,822","No, it's far too big."
637,897,"01:01:15,907","01:01:18,715",But apparently this farmer ain't all about the farm.
638,898,"01:01:20,667","01:01:22,711",How much do you know about Mandingo fighting?
639,899_900_901,"01:01:22,753","01:01:28,809",What? Can you convincingly masquerade as someone who is an expert on Mandingo fighting?
640,902_903_904_905_906,"01:01:28,840","01:01:37,273","Why? Because my character is that of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf, here in Greenville to buy my way into the Mandingo fight game."
641,907_908,"01:01:37,430","01:01:41,361",And your character is a Mandingo expert I hired to help me do it.
642,909,"01:01:41,445","01:01:42,995",They call that One-Eyed Charley.
643,910_911_912,"01:01:46,597","01:01:51,116","Bonjour. Good morning Bonsoir, Good evening, ma petite femme noire. my little black woman."

647,917,"01:02:03,570","01:02:05,357",Ain't nothing lower than a black slaver.
648,918,"01:02:06,337","01:02:09,252",A black slaver is lower than the head house nigger...
649,919,"01:02:10,443","01:02:12,146","and buddy, that's pretty fucking low."
650,920,"01:02:13,791","01:02:15,675",Then play him that way.
651,921,"01:02:15,733","01:02:17,574",Give me your...

657,930,"01:02:42,611","01:02:45,558",So this is the One-Eyed Charley I've heard so much about.
658,931,"01:02:45,560","01:02:47,858","Yes, this is Django Freeman."
659,932,"01:02:48,245","01:02:50,902","Django, this is Mr. Candie's lawyer, Leonide Moguy."
660,933,"01:02:51,088","01:02:52,638",Just call me Leo.
661,934,"01:02:53,062","01:02:56,113",Calvin's in the Julius Caesar room. You all wanna follow me?
662,935,"01:02:56,704","01:02:58,998",How long have you been associated with Mr. Candie?
663,936,"01:02:59,612","01:03:01,168",Calvin's father and I were about...
664,937,"01:03:01,194","01:03:03,157",11 when we went to boarding school together.
665,938,"01:03:03,575","01:03:06,468",Calvin's father's father put me through law school.
666,939,"01:03:06,701","01:03:09,704",One could almost say I was raised to be Calvin's lawyer.
667,940,"01:03:09,871","01:03:11,471",One could almost say youse a nigger.
668,941,"01:03:12,631","01:03:13,601",What did you say?
669,942,"01:03:14,286","01:03:17,039","I said... Nothing, he's just being cheeky."
670,943,"01:03:17,543","01:03:21,964",Anything else about Mr. Candie that I should know before I meet him?
671,944,"01:03:21,966","01:03:24,239","Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile."
672,945,"01:03:24,553","01:03:26,044",What civilized people aren't?
673,946,"01:03:26,095","01:03:28,600",And he prefers Monsieur Candie to Mr. Candie.
674,947,"01:03:28,603","01:03:30,751",Si c'est cela qu'il prefere. Whatever he prefers.
675,948,"01:03:30,771","01:03:32,323",He doesn't speak French.
676,949,"01:03:32,351","01:03:34,705","Don't speak French to him, it'll embarrass him."
677,950,"01:03:38,065","01:03:40,318","Get back on top, now! Turn around!"
678,951,"01:03:40,485","01:03:41,779",There you go.
679,952,"01:03:42,356","01:03:43,456",There you go.
680,953,"01:03:45,734","01:03:48,123",Why do you want to get in the Mandingo business?
681,954,"01:03:50,745","01:03:54,252",You don't intend to allow your second to make the proper introductions?
682,955,"01:03:55,497","01:03:56,699","Quit stalling, now."
683,956,"01:03:57,461","01:03:58,628",Answer the question.
684,957,"01:04:01,297","01:04:02,370",The awful truth?
685,958,"01:04:03,278","01:04:04,357",I'm bored.
686,959,"01:04:04,991","01:04:06,679",This seems like a good bit of fun.
687,960,"01:04:12,183","01:04:14,185","Well, come on over."
688,961,"01:04:14,352","01:04:17,063",We got us a fight going on that's a good bit of fun.
689,962,"01:04:21,108","01:04:22,865",Won't you accompany me to the bar?
690,963,"01:04:31,577","01:04:33,360","You don't wear a hat in the house, white man."
691,964,"01:04:33,362","01:04:34,344",Even I know that.
692,965,"01:04:43,235","01:04:45,038",Dr. Schultz. What a rare pleasure.
693,966,"01:04:45,040","01:04:46,173","Keep fighting, niggers."
694,967,"01:04:46,789","01:04:48,239","And I might add, an honor."
695,968,"01:04:48,724","01:04:49,707",Honor to meet you.
696,969,"01:04:49,709","01:04:51,760","Please have a seat, the pleasure's all mine."
697,970,"01:04:51,762","01:04:54,323",Get free man Django here whatever he wants.
698,971,"01:04:55,268","01:04:57,365",And I'll have sweet tea and bourbon.
699,972,"01:05:17,206","01:05:18,969","Use your weight boy, use your weight!"
700,973,"01:05:18,970","01:05:20,081",There you go.

702,975,"01:05:23,151","01:05:24,182","Come on, now!"
703,976,"01:05:24,589","01:05:27,446","He's not doing what I told him, for God's sakes."
704,977,"01:05:28,200","01:05:29,488","Bravo Luigi, cos   e dai. Good Luigi, go on."
705,978,"01:05:29,778","01:05:31,034",Devi essere pi   rapido. Be more faster.
706,979,"01:05:31,178","01:05:33,897","Come on, now, boy! It's a fight to the death!"
707,980,"01:05:35,443","01:05:37,494",You either hit him or are you ain't?
708,981,"01:05:41,907","01:05:43,256",Ecco I con la spola tappeto. Make the carpet shuttle.

725,998,"01:06:55,887","01:06:57,597",That's why they call him Big Fred.
726,999,"01:06:57,678","01:06:59,322",Worth every penny.
727,1000,"01:06:59,323","01:07:01,098","Well, arrivederci, Luigi."
728,1001,"01:07:01,390","01:07:03,658","Come on up, now, boy. Get yourself a rest."
729,1002,"01:07:03,759","01:07:06,226",You did a fine job. A real fine job.
730,1003_1004_1005,"01:07:07,108","01:07:42,267",Mercedes. Tequila. What's your name?
731,1006_1007,"01:07:44,967","01:07:49,841",Django. Can you spell it?
732,1008_1009_1010_1011,"01:07:52,660","01:07:59,489",D-J-A-N G O The D is silent.

735,1014_1015,"01:08:09,590","01:08:12,875","Mr. Moguy, want you to take care of my new boy here."
736,1016_1017,"01:08:13,083","01:08:17,258","You find him a room with a soft bed, then you bring him up a pony to lick his pole."
737,1018,"01:08:17,764","01:08:20,618","But you be ready to travel to Candyland tomorrow morning, now, ya hear?"
738,1019,"01:08:20,679","01:08:21,680","Yessir, Monsieur Candie."
739,1020_1021,"01:08:21,862","01:08:25,342","Before you go Roscoe, get Fred here a tall beer."
740,1022,"01:08:29,615","01:08:30,791","You enjoy that, boy."
741,1023,"01:08:31,482","01:08:32,401",You've earned it.
742,1024,"01:08:32,770","01:08:33,581",Yes sir.
743,1025,"01:08:43,370","01:08:44,560","What's your name, boy?"
744,1026,"01:08:44,970","01:08:47,166",His name is Django Freeman.
745,1027,"01:08:50,939","01:08:52,181",Where'd you dig him up?
746,1028,"01:08:52,270","01:08:55,653",A fortuitous turn of events brought Django and myself together.
747,1029,"01:08:57,616","01:08:59,101",I've heard tell about you.
748,1030,"01:09:00,374","01:09:03,468",I heard you been telling everybody them Mandingos ain't no damn good.
749,1031,"01:09:03,470","01:09:06,418",Ain't nothing nobody is selling is worth buying. I'm curious...
750,1032,"01:09:07,379","01:09:09,454",what makes you such a Mandingo expert?
751,1033,"01:09:11,783","01:09:13,941",I'm curious what makes you so curious.
752,1034,"01:09:17,537","01:09:19,431","What did you say, boy? Calm down, Butch."
753,1035,"01:09:20,743","01:09:21,966",No offense given...
754,1036,"01:09:22,701","01:09:23,734",none taken.
755,1037,"01:09:24,078","01:09:25,128",Monsieur Candie...
756,1038,"01:09:26,136","01:09:29,485",I'd appreciate if you could direct your line of inquiry toward me.
757,1039_1040,"01:09:29,625","01:09:34,839",One... you do not have anything to drink. Can I get you a tasty refreshment?
758,1041_1042,"01:09:35,005","01:09:37,842",Yes! I'll have a beer. Wunderbar.
759,1043_1044,"01:09:38,107","01:09:42,263","Roscoe, a beer for the man with the beard, and I will have a Polynesian Pearl Diver."
760,1045,"01:09:42,265","01:09:43,586",Do not spare the rum.
761,1046_1047,"01:09:44,140","01:09:47,821",Doc. I am a seasoned slaver.
762,1048_1049,"01:09:48,008","01:09:50,023","You are well, you are a neophyte."
763,1050_1051,"01:09:50,025","01:09:54,706","I'm simply trying to ascertain if this cowboy here, is taking advantage of you."
764,1052_1053,"01:09:56,402","01:09:59,410","With all due respect, Monsieur Candie..."
765,1054,"01:10:00,337","01:10:02,214",I didn't seek you out for your advice.
766,1055_1056,"01:10:02,436","01:10:06,749",I sought you out to purchase a fighting nigger at above top-dollar market price.
767,1057_1058,"01:10:07,371","01:10:12,240","Now I was under the impression, when you granted me an audience, it would be to discuss business."
768,1059,"01:10:15,456","01:10:17,053","Well, we weren't talking business yet."
769,1060,"01:10:17,884","01:10:19,607",We were discussing my curiosity.
770,1061,"01:10:22,428","01:10:23,287",Thank you.
771,1062_1063,"01:10:23,596","01:10:26,034","Roscoe, Coco, go outside and play."
772,1064_1065,"01:10:28,309","01:10:31,145",Sheba... you stay right there.
773,1066,"01:10:31,937","01:10:33,480",I know you didn't mean me.
774,1067_1068_1069_1070_1071,"01:10:35,416","01:10:44,658","Prost! German. Now, according to Moguy, if I do business with you, I'm doing business with both you all."
775,1072,"01:10:44,825","01:10:46,638","He does the eyeballing, you the billfold?"
776,1073,"01:10:46,653","01:10:47,385",Is that it?
777,1074_1075,"01:10:47,481","01:10:51,518","Well, you don't make it sound too flattering, but more or less, yeah."
778,1076_1077,"01:10:53,792","01:10:56,386",So... Bright Boy.
779,1078_1079,"01:10:57,200","01:11:01,001",Moguy tells me you looked over my African flesh and you was none too impressed?
780,1080,"01:11:01,508","01:11:02,823",Not for top dollar.
781,1081,"01:11:05,343","01:11:07,222","Well, then, we got nothing more to talk about."
782,1082_1083,"01:11:07,505","01:11:12,156","You see, you wanna buy a beat-ass nigger from me, those are the beat-ass niggers I wanna sell so..."
783,1084,"01:11:12,203","01:11:14,238",He don't wanna buy the niggers you wanna sell.
784,1085_1086,"01:11:15,022","01:11:17,867","He wants the nigger, you don't wanna sell."
785,1087_1088,"01:11:18,480","01:11:22,344","I don't sell, the niggers, I don't wanna sell."
786,1089_1090,"01:11:25,058","01:11:28,333","Well, you won't sell your best."
787,1091,"01:11:28,744","01:11:30,722",You won't even sell your second best.
788,1092,"01:11:31,330","01:11:33,188",But your third best?
789,1093,"01:11:33,189","01:11:34,736",You don't want to sell him either.
790,1094,"01:11:35,167","01:11:38,875",But if I made you an offer so ridiculous you'd be forced to consider it...
791,1095,"01:11:39,950","01:11:41,994",who knows what could happen?
792,1096,"01:11:44,435","01:11:46,264",And what do you consider ridiculous?
793,1097_1098,"01:11:47,554","01:11:51,447","For a truly talented specimen, the right nigger?"
794,1099,"01:11:53,565","01:11:55,049","How much would you say, Django?"
795,1100,"01:11:58,816","01:12:00,159","$12,000."
796,1101_1102_1103,"01:12:05,072","01:12:10,807","Well, gentlemen, you had my curiosity, but now you have my attention."
797,1104_1105,"01:12:25,048","01:12:29,049",Willie. Hold up! Hold up.
798,1106,"01:12:30,681","01:12:31,878","Good morning, gentlemen."
799,1107,"01:12:32,198","01:12:33,521",Good Dr. Schultz.
800,1108,"01:12:33,724","01:12:35,099","Beautiful morning, isn't it?"
801,1109,"01:12:35,774","01:12:37,187",You couldn't have picked a better one.
802,1110,"01:12:37,400","01:12:40,278","Please, won't you take a ride with us here in the Victoria."
803,1111,"01:12:40,516","01:12:42,059","Oh, thank you very much."
804,1112,"01:12:42,187","01:12:44,063",You can tie your horse up back there.
805,1113_1114_1115_1116_1117_1118,"01:12:52,453","01:13:11,358","Django. Where I part company from many of my phrenologist colleagues is I believe there is a level above bright, above talented, above loyal that a nigger, can aspire to."
806,1119,"01:13:12,107","01:13:13,966","Say, one nigger that just..."
807,1120,"01:13:13,967","01:13:16,041","pops up in 10,000."
808,1121,"01:13:16,810","01:13:18,312",The exceptional nigger.
809,1122,"01:13:19,500","01:13:21,138","Bright day, Bright Boy?"
810,1123,"01:13:22,626","01:13:23,540",Sun is up.
811,1124,"01:13:24,818","01:13:26,381",Shining on all of us.
812,1125,"01:13:31,642","01:13:32,535","Have a seat, doc."
813,1126,"01:13:33,693","01:13:34,369",Thank you.
814,1127,"01:13:34,768","01:13:35,729",Quite an honor.

820,1136_1137,"01:13:56,558","01:13:59,436","The name of the game is keep up, not catch up, nigger."

822,1139,"01:14:18,990","01:14:21,159",Now I saw the whole thing. No harm done.
823,1140,"01:14:21,161","01:14:22,265",Are you kidding me?
824,1141,"01:14:22,267","01:14:24,213",This nigger just... I said no harm done!
825,1142,"01:14:24,456","01:14:26,111",Now take your hand off your pistol!
826,1143_1144,"01:14:27,881","01:14:30,676","Butch, that means you too."

831,1151,"01:14:45,906","01:14:46,828","Yes sir, boss."
832,1152,"01:14:47,031","01:14:49,006","Oh, now you are one lucky nigger."
833,1153,"01:14:50,155","01:14:51,776","You better listen to your boss, white boy."
834,1154,"01:14:51,963","01:14:54,241","Oh, I'm gonna go walking in the moonlight with you."

840,1161,"01:16:04,925","01:16:05,757","No, sir."
841,1162,"01:16:06,038","01:16:07,540",You want a boot heel in it?
842,1163,"01:16:08,702","01:16:09,662","No, sir."
843,1164,"01:16:09,815","01:16:12,197",Then you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.

845,1166,"01:16:16,476","01:16:17,761","Now move, nigger!"
846,1167,"01:16:19,826","01:16:21,954",You niggers are gonna understand something about me.
847,1168,"01:16:22,120","01:16:23,997",I'm worse than any of these white men here.

849,1170_1171,"01:16:28,131","01:16:31,070","He is, a rambunctious sort, ain't he?"
850,1172_1173,"01:16:31,644","01:16:38,510",Indeed. May we stop for a moment so I may put a word in my man's ear?
851,1174_1175_1176_1177,"01:16:38,726","01:16:48,810","You know, I'm expecting to fall in love once I see the specimens at Candyland, so before that moment, it would be good if I could have a confidential strategy meeting with my..."
852,1178_1179,"01:16:49,206","01:16:54,985",confidant. You mind telling me what the hell you doing?
853,1180,"01:16:54,987","01:16:57,030",I confirmed that Broomhilda's at Candyland.
854,1181,"01:17:01,172","01:17:02,142",You're sure it's her?
855,1182_1183_1184,"01:17:02,611","01:17:07,184","He didn't call her by name, but she's a young lady, whip marks on her back and speaks German."
856,1185_1186,"01:17:07,374","01:17:11,932","Now, while it's not wise to assume, in this instance, I think it's pretty safe."
857,1187_1188,"01:17:12,176","01:17:16,498","Point being, don't get so carried away with your retribution."
858,1189,"01:17:17,080","01:17:18,802",You lose sight of why we're here.
859,1190,"01:17:19,069","01:17:20,908","You think I lost sight of that? Yes, I do."
860,1191,"01:17:21,093","01:17:23,047",Stop antagonizing Candie.
861,1192_1193,"01:17:23,598","01:17:28,696","You're going to blow this whole charade, or more than likely get us both killed."
862,1194_1195,"01:17:28,870","01:17:33,541","And I for one, don't intend to die, in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, USA."
863,1196,"01:17:33,904","01:17:35,221",I'm not antagonizing him.
864,1197,"01:17:35,222","01:17:36,570",I'm intriguing him.
865,1198,"01:17:36,979","01:17:39,523",You're yelling abuse at these poor slaves.
866,1199_1200_1201,"01:17:40,353","01:17:47,664","I recall the man, who had me kill another man in front of his son and he didn't bat a eye."

868,1203,"01:17:52,577","01:17:53,911","Yeah, of course I remember."
869,1204,"01:17:53,962","01:17:55,398",What you said was...
870,1205,"01:17:55,777","01:17:57,116",that this is my world...
871,1206,"01:17:58,515","01:17:59,987",and in my world you got to get dirty.
872,1207,"01:18:01,386","01:18:02,770",So that's what I'm doing.
873,1208,"01:18:03,098","01:18:04,116",I'm getting dirty.
874,1209,"01:18:08,144","01:18:11,314","Well, you're paraphrasing a tad, but..."
875,1210,"01:18:12,564","01:18:14,297",that was the general gist.
876,1211,"01:18:18,295","01:18:20,064",See you at Candyland.
877,1212_1213,"01:18:27,621","01:18:30,207","Alright, niggers, back at it."
878,1214,"01:18:31,633","01:18:33,289","That means you too, Moonlight."
879,1215,"01:19:20,924","01:19:22,262",I'll be.
880,1216_1217,"01:19:22,430","01:19:26,964","D'Artagnan! Now, boy, why do a fool thing like run off?"
881,1218,"01:19:27,637","01:19:29,665","I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie."
882,1219,"01:19:30,053","01:19:31,099","Yes, you can."
883,1220,"01:19:31,537","01:19:33,844","You might not be able to win, but your ass can fight."
884,1221,"01:19:34,869","01:19:37,403","Mr. Stonesipher, would you please shut these goddamn dogs up?"
885,1222,"01:19:37,614","01:19:38,868",I cannot hear myself think!
886,1223,"01:19:38,869","01:19:40,177","Quiet down, Marsha!"
887,1224,"01:19:40,326","01:19:42,639","Marsha, hush up! Marsha!"
888,1225,"01:19:42,826","01:19:44,256",Hush up! Hey!
889,1226,"01:19:44,314","01:19:46,815",Get these goddamn dogs away from this nigger!
890,1227,"01:19:56,251","01:19:57,352","Come on now, boy..."

892,1229,"01:19:59,880","01:20:00,909",Yes sir.
893,1230,"01:20:24,112","01:20:25,670",How long was he loose?
894,1231,"01:20:26,406","01:20:27,384",A night.
895,1232_1233,"01:20:28,032","01:20:31,083",Day. Half the other night.
896,1234,"01:20:32,579","01:20:33,881",How far he get off the property?
897,1235,"01:20:34,522","01:20:35,999",About 20 miles off the prop.
898,1236,"01:20:36,611","01:20:38,738",Pretty far considering that limp he got.
899,1237_1238,"01:20:41,087","01:20:44,424","Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan supposed to fight on Friday?"
900,1239,"01:20:44,591","01:20:45,911",One of this new lot.
901,1240_1241,"01:20:47,385","01:20:50,424","Well, way he looks now, a blind Indian would not bet a bead on him."
902,1242,"01:20:50,526","01:20:53,204","Please Monsieur Candie, I ain't got it in me no more."
903,1243,"01:20:53,206","01:20:54,414","Now, now, now, now, now. I can't..."
904,1244,"01:20:54,416","01:20:56,242","Now, no... begging."
905,1245,"01:20:57,610","01:20:59,388",No playing on my soft heart.
906,1246,"01:21:03,343","01:21:04,612","You're in trouble, now son."
907,1247,"01:21:04,613","01:21:05,656",Yes sir.
908,1248,"01:21:08,232","01:21:09,232",You know.
909,1249,"01:21:09,564","01:21:11,854",I done paid $500 for you.
910,1250_1251_1252,"01:21:12,677","01:21:19,092",When I pay $500 then    I expect to get five fights out of a nigger before he roll over and play dead.
911,1253_1254_1255,"01:21:19,093","01:21:23,121","Sir. You got to understand, that I'm running a business here."
912,1256,"01:21:24,063","01:21:25,889",You fought three fights.
913,1257,"01:21:25,890","01:21:27,120",But I won every one.
914,1258,"01:21:27,122","01:21:28,055","Yes, you did."
915,1259,"01:21:28,056","01:21:31,471","Yes, you did but that last one, you muddled the line between winning and losing."
916,1260,"01:21:31,638","01:21:32,507",Yes sir.
917,1261,"01:21:35,350","01:21:36,845","Still, the fact remains."
918,1262,"01:21:37,720","01:21:40,822","I pay $500, I want five goddamn fights!"
919,1263,"01:21:41,826","01:21:43,415",So what about my $500?
920,1264,"01:21:46,058","01:21:47,611",What about my $500?
921,1265,"01:21:49,358","01:21:50,702",You gonna reimburse me?
922,1266,"01:21:57,108","01:21:59,054",You even know what reimburse means?
923,1267,"01:22:07,674","01:22:09,034",I'll reimburse you!
924,1268,"01:22:13,317","01:22:14,111",You will?
925,1269_1270_1271,"01:22:15,775","01:22:26,280","Yep. You'll pay $500, for practically a one-eyed old Joe ain't fit to push a broom?"
926,1272,"01:22:26,429","01:22:27,371","No, he won't."
927,1273,"01:22:29,777","01:22:31,580",He just tired of you toying with him is all.
928,1274,"01:22:33,028","01:22:34,317","Matter of fact, so am I."
929,1275,"01:22:35,440","01:22:37,232",But we ain't paying a penny for that pickaninny.
930,1276,"01:22:37,596","01:22:39,476","Ain't got no use for him. Ain't that right, doc?"
931,1277,"01:22:41,041","01:22:41,982",You heard him.
932,1278,"01:22:51,805","01:22:55,428",You're gonna have to excuse Mr. Stonesipher's slack-jawed gaze.
933,1279,"01:22:56,498","01:22:59,168",He ain't never seen a nigger like you ever in his life.
934,1280,"01:23:00,019","01:23:01,638","Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?"
935,1281,"01:23:04,209","01:23:05,198",That right.
936,1282,"01:23:06,483","01:23:07,487",For that matter...
937,1283,"01:23:09,297","01:23:10,351",nor have I.
938,1284_1285,"01:23:16,785","01:23:22,248",Now... seeing as you won't pay a penny for this pickaninny here...
939,1286,"01:23:24,892","01:23:27,920",you won't mind me handling this nigger any way I see fit?
940,1287,"01:23:29,323","01:23:30,542",He's your nigger.
941,1288,"01:23:34,659","01:23:36,049",Mr. Stonesipher?
942,1289,"01:23:37,815","01:23:40,642",Let Marsha and her bitches send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.
943,1290,"01:23:41,518","01:23:45,882","Marsha! Marsha, hey, get him!"
944,1291,"01:23:47,774","01:23:49,984","Get him, get him!"
945,1292_1293_1294,"01:23:51,146","01:24:27,856",Yeah! Your boss looks a little green around the gills for a blood sport like nigger fighting.
946,1295_1296,"01:24:28,231","01:24:32,744","Nah, he just ain't used to seeing a man ripped apart by dogs is all."
947,1297,"01:24:35,613","01:24:36,866",You are used to it?
948,1298,"01:24:37,405","01:24:39,879",I'm just a little more used to Americans than he is.
949,1299_1300,"01:24:41,645","01:24:44,479","Now, Monsieur Candie..."
950,1301,"01:24:45,165","01:24:46,280",whenever you're ready.
951,1302,"01:24:47,206","01:24:49,770",We rode five hours so you could show off your stock.
952,1303,"01:24:50,456","01:24:51,753",Let's get to it.
953,1304_1305,"01:24:53,869","01:24:57,612","Because as of now, if he's an example, I ain't impressed."
954,1306,"01:25:00,209","01:25:01,244",Follow me.
955,1307,"01:26:58,631","01:27:01,210","Line them up to the left here now, boy."
956,1308,"01:27:02,969","01:27:04,476","Stand up straight, now!"
957,1309,"01:27:05,513","01:27:06,806",Get up there.

962,1314,"01:28:13,568","01:28:15,201","Hello! Stephen, my boy!"
963,1315,"01:28:15,206","01:28:17,548","Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hello, my ass."
964,1316,"01:28:18,139","01:28:20,838","Who, this nigger up on that nag?"
965,1317,"01:28:21,352","01:28:22,740","Stephen, you have nails for breakfast?"
966,1318,"01:28:23,250","01:28:24,808",What's a matter? Why you so ornery?
967,1319,"01:28:24,809","01:28:26,692","You miss me? Oh, yes sir."
968,1320_1321,"01:28:27,319","01:28:30,762","I miss you, like a hog miss slop!"
969,1322,"01:28:30,851","01:28:34,179",Like a baby miss mammy's titty.
970,1323,"01:28:34,903","01:28:38,938",I miss you like I misses a rock in my shoe.
971,1324_1325,"01:28:41,384","01:28:45,993","Now I ask you, who this nigger on that nag?"
972,1326,"01:28:45,995","01:28:46,982","Hey, Snowball?"
973,1327_1328,"01:28:48,805","01:28:52,203","Wanna know my name or the name of my horse, you ask me."
974,1329,"01:28:52,622","01:28:55,446","Just who the hell you calling Snowball, horse boy?"

980,1336,"01:29:08,011","01:29:10,263",Let me at least introduce the two of you.
981,1337_1338,"01:29:10,430","01:29:14,334","Django, this is another cheeky black bugger like yourself, Stephen."
982,1339,"01:29:14,541","01:29:16,087","Stephen, this here's Django."
983,1340,"01:29:16,387","01:29:17,645",You two oughta hate each other.
984,1341_1342,"01:29:17,812","01:29:22,082","Calvin, just who the hell is this nigger you feels the need to entertain?"
985,1343,"01:29:22,148","01:29:26,068","Django and his friend in gray here, Dr. Schultz, are customers."
986,1344,"01:29:26,366","01:29:27,743","And they are our guests, Stephen."
987,1345,"01:29:27,778","01:29:31,538","And you, you old decrepit bastard, oughta show them every hospitality."
988,1346,"01:29:31,540","01:29:34,026",You understand that? Yes sir. Him I understand.
989,1347,"01:29:34,028","01:29:35,862",But I don't know why I got to take lip off this nigger.
990,1348,"01:29:35,863","01:29:38,291",You don't have to know why. Do you understand?
991,1349,"01:29:39,573","01:29:41,074",Yes sir. I understand.
992,1350,"01:29:41,077","01:29:42,387","Well, good."
993,1351,"01:29:42,865","01:29:43,776",They're spending the night.
994,1352,"01:29:43,778","01:29:45,593",Go up in the guest bedrooms and get two ready.
995,1353,"01:29:46,953","01:29:48,621",He gonna stay in The Big House?
996,1354,"01:29:48,779","01:29:50,430","Stephen, he's a slaver."
997,1355,"01:29:50,596","01:29:52,570",It's different. In The Big House?
998,1356,"01:29:52,695","01:29:53,977","Well, you got a problem with that?"
999,1357_1358_1359_1360,"01:29:53,992","01:30:02,299","Oh, no. I ain't got no problem with it, if you ain't got no problem with burning the bed, the sheets, the pillowcases, everything else when this black-ass motherfucker's gone! That is my problem!"
1000,1361,"01:30:02,300","01:30:03,374",They are mine to burn!
1001,1362,"01:30:03,566","01:30:05,776",Now your problem right now is making a good impression!
1002,1363_1364,"01:30:06,115","01:30:09,819",And I want you to start solving that problem right now and get them goddamn rooms ready!
1003,1365,"01:30:11,933","01:30:13,148","Yes sir, Monsieur Candie."
1004,1366,"01:30:15,036","01:30:16,083","Go on, now."
1005,1367,"01:30:17,121","01:30:19,540",Can't believe you brought a nigger to stay in The Big House.
1006,1368,"01:30:19,707","01:30:21,975",Your daddy rolling over in his goddamned grave.
1007,1369,"01:30:21,977","01:30:24,821","Man, the lip on him. He's getting worse and worse."
1008,1370_1371,"01:30:24,921","01:30:30,772","Now, where is my beautiful sister?"
1009,1372,"01:30:31,289","01:30:32,566",There she is!
1010,1373_1374,"01:30:34,701","01:30:39,393","Dr. Schultz, this attractive Southern belle is my widowed sister."
1011,1375_1376,"01:30:39,560","01:30:43,564","Darling, you are a tonic for tired eyes."
1012,1377_1378,"01:30:44,816","01:30:48,445","May I present to you, Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly."
1013,1379,"01:30:48,593","01:30:52,052","Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charly. Y'all get your ass over by that pen."
1014,1380,"01:30:52,054","01:30:54,362","Come on, Charly. Come on, now! Let's go."
1015,1381,"01:30:54,364","01:30:55,407",You know where it is.
1016,1382,"01:30:55,409","01:30:56,924",Like you on a rope!
1017,1383,"01:30:58,371","01:31:00,877","Niggers don't walk around here, niggers run!"
1018,1384,"01:31:02,036","01:31:03,637",Monsieur Candie?
1019,1385_1386,"01:31:05,002","01:31:08,678",Yeah. About that matter about the nigger girl you were talking about?
1020,1387,"01:31:09,059","01:31:10,018",Nigger gal?
1021,1388,"01:31:10,091","01:31:13,353","Yeah, I believe you mentioned she spoke German."
1022,1389,"01:31:14,255","01:31:15,834","Yes! Hilda, what about her?"
1023,1390_1391,"01:31:16,360","01:31:20,450","Do you think before the demonstration, you could send her around to my room?"
1024,1392,"01:31:20,889","01:31:22,949","You little dickens, you."
1025,1393,"01:31:23,660","01:31:24,930",I don't see why not.
1026,1394_1395_1396_1397,"01:31:24,932","01:31:31,654","Stephen, when you get through showing them to their rooms, go fetch Hilda, get her cleaned up and smelling real nice, and sent over to Dr. Schultz's room here."
1027,1398_1399,"01:31:31,734","01:31:36,325","Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir, there is a something I ain't told you about yet."
1028,1400_1401,"01:31:36,685","01:31:40,068",What? Hilda in the Hot Box.
1029,1402,"01:31:42,120","01:31:43,170",What's she doing there?
1030,1403,"01:31:43,347","01:31:45,847",What you think she doing there in the Hot Box?
1031,1404,"01:31:45,912","01:31:46,998",She being punished.
1032,1405,"01:31:47,587","01:31:49,744",What she do? She run off again.
1033,1406,"01:31:50,432","01:31:53,269","Jesus Christ Stephen, how many people ran away while I was gone?"
1034,1407_1408,"01:31:53,271","01:31:55,682",Two. When did she go?
1035,1409,"01:31:55,760","01:31:58,094",Last night. They brung her back this morning.
1036,1410,"01:31:58,936","01:32:01,269",How bad did Stonesipher's dogs tear her up?
1037,1411,"01:32:02,038","01:32:05,456","Lucky for her, they was out chasing D'Artagnan's ass."
1038,1412_1413,"01:32:05,785","01:32:09,031","Bill and Cody went looking for her, found her, brung her back."
1039,1414,"01:32:10,217","01:32:11,526","Now, she a little beat-up."
1040,1415_1416,"01:32:11,527","01:32:14,475",But she done that to her own damn self running through them damn bushes and shit.
1041,1417,"01:32:14,570","01:32:16,026",How long she been in the box?
1042,1418,"01:32:16,282","01:32:19,338",How long you think she been in there? All damn day.
1043,1419,"01:32:19,440","01:32:22,029",And the little bitch got ten more days to be in there.
1044,1420,"01:32:22,791","01:32:24,015","Still, take her out."
1045,1421,"01:32:24,179","01:32:25,453",Take her out? Why?
1046,1422,"01:32:25,455","01:32:27,394","Because I said so, that's why."
1047,1423,"01:32:27,395","01:32:29,376",Dr. Schultz is my guest.
1048,1424,"01:32:29,526","01:32:30,736",Hilda is my nigger.
1049,1425_1426,"01:32:30,738","01:32:34,032","Southern hospitality dictates, I make her available to him."
1050,1427,"01:32:34,034","01:32:35,889","But, Monsieur Candie, she run off."
1051,1428,"01:32:35,890","01:32:37,253","Jesus Christ, Stephen."
1052,1429_1430,"01:32:37,255","01:32:42,352",What is the point of having a nigger that speaks German if you can't wheel them out when you have a German guest?
1053,1431,"01:32:42,577","01:32:46,604","Now, I realize it is inconvenient, but still, you take her ass out."
1054,1432,"01:32:46,771","01:32:47,647",Yes sir.
1055,1433,"01:32:49,232","01:32:50,303",Lara Lee!
1056,1434_1435,"01:32:50,304","01:32:55,551",Will you and Cora be responsible for getting Hilda cleaned up and presentable for Dr. Schultz here.
1057,1436,"01:32:55,646","01:32:57,023","Of course, darling."
1058,1437_1438,"01:32:57,073","01:33:01,953","Now gentlemen, I do apologize, but I am weary from our travels beyond words."
1059,1439,"01:33:02,345","01:33:04,722",It is time for me to rest my tired eyes.
1060,1440,"01:33:09,957","01:33:12,588",Y'all done heard the man! Get her ass up outta there!
1061,1441_1442,"01:33:13,144","01:33:15,001",Cora! Come here!
1062,1443_1444,"01:33:15,466","01:33:18,700","Get over there and get her cleaned up, bring her back over here to Dr..."
1063,1445,"01:33:18,934","01:33:21,042",What he say your name is? Shoots? Schultz.
1064,1446_1447,"01:33:21,386","01:33:24,003","Schultz. Get her back over here. Hurry up, girl."
1065,1448,"01:33:24,005","01:33:24,731",Yes sir.
1066,1449,"01:34:11,061","01:34:12,057","Come on, girl."
1067,1450,"01:34:12,724","01:34:13,524",Stand up.
1068,1451,"01:34:43,694","01:34:46,935",Is you coming with me or is you gonna sleep in that little box over yonder?
1069,1452,"01:36:22,278","01:36:23,737","Hello, ladies."
1070,1453,"01:36:23,904","01:36:24,969",Dr. Schultz.
1071,1454,"01:36:25,485","01:36:27,344",May I introduce to you Broomhilda?
1072,1455,"01:36:31,454","01:36:33,126","Hilda, this is Dr. Schultz."
1073,1456,"01:36:35,522","01:36:37,501","It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda."
1074,1457,"01:36:38,906","01:36:40,880",I've heard a lot of good things about you.
1075,1458,"01:36:41,046","01:36:44,008","Well, it's not every nigger speaks German, don't ya know."
1076,1459_1460,"01:36:47,094","01:36:53,979","As I look at you now, Broomhilda, I can see all the passions you inspire are completely justified."
1077,1461,"01:36:57,789","01:36:59,587",The doctor here speaks German.
1078,1462,"01:37:02,049","01:37:04,009",And I've been informed you do as well?
1079,1463,"01:37:05,404","01:37:07,573","Go ahead, girl. Speak a little German."
1080,1464_1465,"01:37:16,468","01:37:26,639",Astonishing. And I shall bring you... Much obliged.
1081,1466_1467,"01:37:36,602","01:38:00,032",Yes. Don't be afraid.
1082,1468,"01:38:01,180","01:38:02,355",Don't be afraid.
1083,1469_1470,"01:38:42,103","01:38:51,719",Pardon. Thank you.
1084,1471,"01:40:20,534","01:40:22,222",I promise.
1085,1472,"01:40:37,772","01:40:39,089","Hey, Little Trouble Maker."
1086,1473,"01:40:48,274","01:40:50,732","You silver-tongued devil, you."
1087,1474,"01:40:52,548","01:40:54,297","Hurry up, girl. These ready, Miss Cora."
1088,1475,"01:40:54,388","01:40:55,835","No, no, no, they drinking tonight."
1089,1476,"01:40:55,851","01:40:58,576","Go downstairs, get the big jug with the red stuff Monsieur Candie like, hear?"
1090,1477,"01:40:58,758","01:41:00,349",Get your big pretty ass out the way.
1091,1478,"01:41:00,380","01:41:01,746",You know you like it.
1092,1479,"01:41:02,280","01:41:04,056",That's because you knows what I like.
1093,1480,"01:41:04,127","01:41:06,794","Come on with these biscuits, girl."
1094,1481_1482,"01:41:07,011","01:41:11,916","Look, Monsieur Candie, they were all fine specimens, no doubt about it."
1095,1483,"01:41:12,609","01:41:15,518",But the best three by far were...
1096,1484_1485,"01:41:15,956","01:41:19,966",Samson. What's that other one's name? Goldie.
1097,1486_1487,"01:41:20,117","01:41:23,097",Goldie. And Eskimo Joe.
1098,1488,"01:41:23,789","01:41:25,991","By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?"
1099,1489,"01:41:26,532","01:41:29,460",You never know how these nigger nicknames get started.
1100,1490,"01:41:29,626","01:41:32,212","His name was Joe, maybe one day he said he was cold."
1101,1491,"01:41:32,214","01:41:33,357",Who knows?
1102,1492_1493,"01:41:36,354","01:41:39,316","Well, regardless, Samson's your best."
1103,1494,"01:41:39,898","01:41:41,066",We all know that.
1104,1495_1496,"01:41:41,559","01:41:43,973","You will never sell him, and I can see why."
1105,1497,"01:41:44,231","01:41:45,703",He's a champion.
1106,1498,"01:41:47,012","01:41:48,707",All three are champions.
1107,1499,"01:41:49,688","01:41:50,943",Samson's the champion.
1108,1500,"01:41:52,143","01:41:53,501",Them other two pretty good.
1109,1501,"01:41:55,197","01:41:56,628","Calvin, now what's this nigger you let..."
1110,1502,"01:41:56,695","01:41:58,033",It's alright. It's alright.
1111,1503_1504_1505,"01:41:58,097","01:42:08,247","You have to understand, Monsieur Candie, while admittedly a neophyte, in the nigger fight game, I do have a little bit of a background in the European traveling circus."
1112,1506,"01:42:08,248","01:42:09,333",Is that right?
1113,1507_1508,"01:42:09,644","01:42:13,587","Hence, I have big ideas when it comes to presentation."
1114,1509,"01:42:15,046","01:42:17,150",I need something more than just a big nigger.
1115,1510,"01:42:19,258","01:42:21,478","Yeah, he needs to have panache."
1116,1511,"01:42:21,602","01:42:23,626",Need to have what? What? Panache.
1117,1512,"01:42:25,050","01:42:27,728","A sense of Showmanship. Showmanship, yes."
1118,1513_1514,"01:42:27,730","01:42:31,397",I want to be able to bill him as The Black Hercules.
1119,1515,"01:42:32,949","01:42:34,595","The Black Hercules, isn't that clever?"
1120,1516,"01:42:34,673","01:42:35,674",More like Nigger-les.
1121,1517_1518_1519,"01:42:38,030","01:42:43,251","I said and I told, I would pay top dollar, for..."
1122,1520,"01:42:43,989","01:42:45,863",the right nigger.
1123,1521,"01:42:46,794","01:42:50,063","Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger, per se."
1124,1522,"01:42:51,218","01:42:53,616",But is he right as rain?
1125,1523_1524_1525_1526_1527_1528,"01:42:55,087","01:43:04,946","Oh, Dr. Schultz, I will have you know, there is no one, in the nigger fight game that appreciates the value of showmanship more than Monsieur Calvin J. Candie here."
1126,1529_1530,"01:43:04,948","01:43:09,184",Nobody. But one must not forget the most important thing in the nigger fight game.
1127,1531,"01:43:09,351","01:43:11,923",And that is a nigger that can win fights.
1128,1532,"01:43:12,896","01:43:17,109","Now that should be your first, second, third, fourth, and fifth concern."
1129,1533_1534_1535,"01:43:17,276","01:43:22,694","Now, after you have that, and you know you have that, then you can start, to implement a grand design."
1130,1536_1537,"01:43:23,513","01:43:26,281","In other words, first thing is first."
1131,1538,"01:43:26,326","01:43:27,786",First thing's first.
1132,1539,"01:43:36,896","01:43:38,747",I see you two getting on.
1133,1540_1541_1542_1543_1544,"01:43:39,742","01:43:48,051","Famously. Oh, Monsieur Candie, you can't imagine what it's like not to hear your native tongue, in four years."
1134,1545,"01:43:48,083","01:43:50,353","Well, hell, I can't imagine two weeks in Boston."
1135,1546,"01:43:52,516","01:43:53,926",Two weeks in Boston!
1136,1547,"01:43:54,383","01:43:56,146","Monsieur Candie, you a mess!"
1137,1548,"01:43:57,302","01:43:58,997",Two weeks in Boston!
1138,1549_1550,"01:43:59,276","01:44:04,489",I can't express the joy I felt conversing in my mother tongue.
1139,1551,"01:44:04,656","01:44:08,988",And Hilda is a charming conversation companion.
1140,1552,"01:44:09,051","01:44:11,198","Well, be careful now, Dr. Schultz."
1141,1553,"01:44:11,518","01:44:13,707",You might-a caught yourself a little dose of nigger love.
1142,1554,"01:44:14,329","01:44:16,340","Nigger love's a powerful emotion, boy."
1143,1555,"01:44:16,825","01:44:18,578",It's like a pool of black tar.
1144,1556,"01:44:18,624","01:44:20,251","Once it catches your ass, you're caught."
1145,1557,"01:44:20,388","01:44:21,947","Yes sir, you stuck."
1146,1558,"01:44:23,292","01:44:24,573","I don't know, doctor."
1147,1559_1560,"01:44:25,090","01:44:28,267","You can lay on all the German sweet talk you want, but..."
1148,1561,"01:44:28,268","01:44:31,740",it looks like this pony's got big eyes for Django.
1149,1562_1563,"01:44:34,552","01:44:36,987","Well, naturally."
1150,1564_1565_1566,"01:44:37,062","01:44:42,312","It is the soaring, eagle that attracts her attention, not the plucked chicken."
1151,1567,"01:44:43,654","01:44:46,661","Dr. Schultz, don't be so down on yourself."
1152,1568,"01:44:46,663","01:44:48,575",You are quite the dapper European gentleman.
1153,1569_1570,"01:44:48,590","01:44:51,900","You got to clean these dishes, you got to put your elbow in these dishes, you hear me?"
1154,1571,"01:44:51,981","01:44:54,006","You know that nigger, don't you?"
1155,1572,"01:44:55,204","01:44:56,325",Who? Who?
1156,1573,"01:44:56,500","01:44:59,031","Don't who me, bitch. You know who I'm talking about."
1157,1574,"01:45:01,463","01:45:02,594",At the table?
1158,1575,"01:45:03,486","01:45:04,633",I don't know him.
1159,1576,"01:45:05,052","01:45:06,430",You don't know him.
1160,1577_1578,"01:45:06,838","01:45:09,038","No. No, what?"
1161,1579,"01:45:09,749","01:45:10,665","No, sir."
1162,1580,"01:45:15,780","01:45:17,611","You would not lie to me now, would you?"
1163,1581_1582,"01:45:22,384","01:45:27,729",Ok. Yeah. If you say so.
1164,1583_1584,"01:45:34,204","01:45:37,518","Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger, no doubt about it."
1165,1585_1586,"01:45:39,275","01:45:44,250","But if it was my money, I would not pay no $12,000 for him."
1166,1587,"01:45:44,504","01:45:46,259",What would your price be?
1167,1588_1589_1590,"01:45:46,842","01:45:52,276","Well, if I was inclined to be generous, and I don't know why, I would be inclined to be generous..."
1168,1591_1592_1593_1594_1595,"01:45:53,390","01:46:03,692","9,000. Maybe. Dr. Schultz, let me reclarify how this whole negotiation came about."
1169,1596,"01:46:04,204","01:46:06,437","You see, it wasn't me who came to you to sell a nigger."
1170,1597,"01:46:06,507","01:46:07,286",Sure wasn't.
1171,1598,"01:46:07,289","01:46:09,309",It was you who approached me to buy one.
1172,1599,"01:46:09,339","01:46:10,257",Sure was.
1173,1600,"01:46:10,429","01:46:14,358","Now, that $9,000 figure Bright Boy's been bandying about, that ain't too far off from right."
1174,1601_1602,"01:46:14,365","01:46:18,623","And if I wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that, I could do so any day of the week. Any day."
1175,1603,"01:46:19,162","01:46:21,116","But, like you said in Greenville, doctor..."
1176,1604,"01:46:21,740","01:46:23,100",I don't want to sell him.
1177,1605,"01:46:23,920","01:46:24,993",It was only your...
1178,1606_1607,"01:46:25,601","01:46:30,330","ridiculous offer of $12,000 that made me even consider it."
1179,1608,"01:46:39,426","01:46:43,190","You know, Monsieur Candie, you do possess the power of persuasion."
1180,1609,"01:46:47,420","01:46:49,980","Why not? Monsieur Candie, you have a deal."
1181,1610,"01:46:49,982","01:46:52,259","Eskimo Joe, $12,000."
1182,1611,"01:46:52,466","01:46:53,420","Hooray, doctor."
1183,1612,"01:46:53,451","01:46:55,492",Hooray. And a wise decision that is.
1184,1613,"01:46:55,743","01:46:58,956","However, that is a tremendous amount of money."
1185,1614,"01:46:59,391","01:47:02,454","And the way you have your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer."
1186,1615,"01:47:02,542","01:47:04,336",Persnickety man named Tuttle.
1187,1616_1617,"01:47:04,727","01:47:11,464",And I would need my Mr. Tuttle to draw up a legal contract before I'd feel comfortable exchanging that amount of money for flesh.
1188,1618_1619,"01:47:12,135","01:47:16,516","Not to mention having Eskimo Joe examined, by a physician of my choosing. Naturally."
1189,1620,"01:47:17,110","01:47:21,002","So, say I return in about..."
1190,1621,"01:47:23,848","01:47:25,941",five days time. Five days?
1191,1622,"01:47:26,108","01:47:27,475",With my Mr. Tuttle.
1192,1623_1624,"01:47:27,695","01:47:32,199","And then my Mr. Tuttle and your Mr. Moguy, can hash out the finer details between themselves."
1193,1625,"01:47:33,732","01:47:35,365","I say splendid, doctor."
1194,1626_1627_1628,"01:47:35,639","01:47:41,267",Splendid. Gentlemen... may I propose a toast.
1195,1629,"01:47:43,974","01:47:45,627",To Eskimo Joe.
1196,1630,"01:47:45,628","01:47:47,571",Or shall we call him.
1197,1631,"01:47:47,945","01:47:49,216",The Black Hercules?
1198,1632,"01:47:50,144","01:47:51,591",To The Black Hercules.
1199,1633,"01:47:51,758","01:47:53,135",The Black Hercules.
1200,1634,"01:47:53,301","01:47:54,719",To The Black Hercules.
1201,1635,"01:47:54,886","01:47:56,319","You was right, doctor."
1202,1636,"01:47:56,320","01:47:57,777",That name do have pan-ass.
1203,1637_1638,"01:48:00,775","01:48:03,543","Hilda, top my drink off."
1204,1639_1640,"01:48:06,815","01:48:10,925","So Hilda, how you like serving at the big table in The Big House?"
1205,1641,"01:48:12,135","01:48:14,562","When Monsieur Candie talk to you, you answers."
1206,1642,"01:48:15,526","01:48:17,403","I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie."
1207,1643,"01:48:18,536","01:48:22,476",It's a lot better than sizzling in that Hot Box or dragging your ass through a bramble bush.
1208,1644_1645,"01:48:22,908","01:48:27,173","But maybe it's not quite as much fun as getting to pleasure all them Mandingos, Sugar bear? Oh, Lord."
1209,1646,"01:48:27,174","01:48:27,940",She like them niggers.
1210,1647,"01:48:27,958","01:48:28,936",Sure do. Like Samson?
1211,1648,"01:48:28,945","01:48:29,984","No, sir."
1212,1649_1650_1651,"01:48:30,714","01:48:39,183","You know, Monsieur Candie, the doctor here might be interested in seeing Hilda's peeled back, seeing as how they don't have many niggers where he come from."
1213,1652_1653_1654,"01:48:39,472","01:48:44,114","Dr. Schultz, when you was alone with Hilda, here, did you just speak German or..."
1214,1655,"01:48:44,115","01:48:45,411",did you get to take her clothes off?
1215,1656,"01:48:45,478","01:48:46,830","No, we just talked and..."
1216,1657,"01:48:47,053","01:48:49,078","Oh, so you haven't seen her back?"
1217,1658,"01:48:49,587","01:48:51,684","I haven't... No, no, no, no."
1218,1659,"01:48:51,692","01:48:53,599","Stephen's right, you might find this interesting."
1219,1660,"01:48:53,841","01:48:56,908","Hilda, go on, take off your dress. Show Dr. Schultz your back here."
1220,1661,"01:48:57,056","01:48:58,347",Go on. Calvin.
1221,1662,"01:48:59,177","01:49:01,369",I just got her all dressed up and looking nice.
1222,1663,"01:49:01,536","01:49:04,637","But, Lara Lee, Dr. Schultz is from Dusseldorf."
1223,1664,"01:49:04,806","01:49:06,208",They don't got niggers there.
1224,1665,"01:49:06,209","01:49:07,876",He is a man of medicine.
1225,1666,"01:49:07,946","01:49:10,735","I'm sure it would fascinate him, the niggers' endurance for pain."
1226,1667,"01:49:10,844","01:49:14,291","These niggers are tough, Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it."
1227,1668,"01:49:14,377","01:49:16,850",Hilda's got something like four lashes on her back.
1228,1669,"01:49:16,852","01:49:19,199","Lara Lee just get one, she'd lose her goddamn mind."
1229,1670,"01:49:19,201","01:49:20,331","Sure would. Look at that, doctor."
1230,1671,"01:49:20,333","01:49:22,042",It's like a painting. Look at that. Calvin!
1231,1672,"01:49:23,073","01:49:25,946",We are eating. Ain't no one wanna look at her whipped up back.
1232,1673,"01:49:28,407","01:49:30,190","Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine."
1233,1674,"01:49:30,743","01:49:32,078","After dinner, then, Stephen."
1234,1675,"01:49:32,227","01:49:33,104",After dinner.
1235,1676,"01:49:34,463","01:49:35,744","During the brandies, gentlemen?"
1236,1677,"01:49:42,410","01:49:43,954","Cora, come get this girl!"
1237,1678,"01:49:47,415","01:49:48,446",She a mess.
1238,1679,"01:49:48,879","01:49:49,802","Yes, ma'am."
1239,1680,"01:49:50,794","01:49:52,350",Why are you all undone?
1240,1681,"01:49:52,351","01:49:53,345",I just got you done up.
1241,1682,"01:49:53,347","01:49:54,552",Come on in here.
1242,1683_1684,"01:50:01,263","01:50:05,280","Baby, you on Stephen bad side, and you need to be on his blind side."
1243,1685,"01:50:05,396","01:50:07,231",You say you ain't know him.
1244,1686_1687,"01:50:09,562","01:50:14,682","I said, you said you ain't know him."
1245,1688,"01:50:16,319","01:50:17,300",I don't.
1246,1689,"01:50:18,453","01:50:19,510","Yes, you do."
1247,1690,"01:50:22,186","01:50:23,306",Mr. Stephen...
1248,1691,"01:50:24,721","01:50:25,495",I don't.
1249,1692,"01:50:26,060","01:50:27,833",Why is you lying to me?
1250,1693,"01:50:30,542","01:50:31,530",I ain't.
1251,1694,"01:50:32,562","01:50:33,794",Then why is you crying?
1252,1695,"01:50:35,202","01:50:36,615",You scaring me.
1253,1696,"01:50:37,048","01:50:38,439",Why is I'm scaring you?
1254,1697,"01:50:39,542","01:50:40,760",Because you scary.
1255,1698_1699,"01:50:42,637","01:50:48,453",To speak German this afternoon with Hilda was positively soul-enriching.
1256,1700,"01:50:49,185","01:50:51,238","Doctor, that warms my heart to hear that."
1257,1701,"01:50:52,450","01:50:54,602",You stay right here.
1258,1702_1703,"01:51:00,405","01:51:05,127","You indicated earlier, you'd be willing to part with Hilda."
1259,1704,"01:51:05,404","01:51:07,757","Why, yes. Yessiree bob, I did."
1260,1705_1706,"01:51:10,079","01:51:13,369","In that case, allow me..."
1261,1707,"01:51:13,973","01:51:15,785",to propose another proposition.
1262,1708,"01:51:16,320","01:51:17,220",I'm all ears.
1263,1709,"01:51:17,455","01:51:19,165","Hurry up, goddamn it!"
1264,1710,"01:51:20,110","01:51:21,490",Monsieur Candie... Stephen!
1265,1711,"01:51:22,716","01:51:24,633",You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here.
1266,1712,"01:51:26,139","01:51:28,379","I'm sorry, Dr. Schultz."
1267,1713,"01:51:28,736","01:51:31,144",My ears ain't worth a damn these days.
1268,1714,"01:51:31,311","01:51:32,437",Excuse him.
1269,1715,"01:51:32,604","01:51:35,425","Monsieur Candie, could I get a word with you in the kitchen?"
1270,1716,"01:51:36,734","01:51:38,443",You mean get up out of my chair?
1271,1717,"01:51:38,819","01:51:40,691",If'n you could manage it.
1272,1718_1719,"01:51:40,974","01:51:44,055",Why? It's about dessert.
1273,1720,"01:51:44,056","01:51:45,367",What about dessert?
1274,1721,"01:51:46,184","01:51:48,599",I'd rather discuss that in private.
1275,1722,"01:51:48,912","01:51:50,711",We're having white cake!
1276,1723,"01:51:51,234","01:51:53,446",What sort of melodrama could be brewing back there?
1277,1724,"01:51:53,893","01:51:57,595","You right, Monsieur Candie. You right. I'll handle it myself."
1278,1725,"01:51:57,962","01:51:59,756",Meet me in the library.
1279,1726,"01:51:59,923","01:52:03,278",I just can't understand why you won't come talk to these niggers.
1280,1727,"01:52:03,286","01:52:05,166","Shit get fucked up around here, you blame me."
1281,1728,"01:52:05,385","01:52:07,311","Fine! Fine. Friend Stephen, I..."
1282,1729,"01:52:08,311","01:52:09,988",I will be along momentarily.
1283,1730,"01:52:10,392","01:52:11,296",Yes sir.
1284,1731_1732_1733_1734_1735,"01:52:12,586","01:52:22,177","Well, gentlemen, as you can see talented as they are, no doubt, in the kitchen, from time to time, adult supervision is required."
1285,1736,"01:52:24,864","01:52:26,431",If you'll excuse me a moment.
1286,1737,"01:52:32,831","01:52:34,624",You may clear the dinner service.
1287,1738,"01:52:36,165","01:52:37,666",You heard him. Go on! Get.
1288,1739,"01:52:39,040","01:52:39,993","Hurry up, girl."
1289,1740_1741,"01:52:40,031","01:52:44,574","So, Dr. Schultz, why don't you regale us with a tale of the circus."
1290,1742,"01:52:45,564","01:52:47,008",The circus?
1291,1743,"01:52:54,469","01:52:55,772",What is the matter?

1441,1976,"02:07:07,563","02:07:08,950",You doubt he'd approve?
1442,1977_1978,"02:07:11,250","02:07:16,144",Yes. His approval would be a dubious proposition at best.
